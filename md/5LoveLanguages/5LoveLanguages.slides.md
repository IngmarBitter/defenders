## Love Language #1: Words of Affirmation

![](WordsOfAffirmation.jpg style="float: right; width: 5rem")

* Words rather than actions
* Unsolicited compliments 
* "I love you"
* Insults can leave you shattered and are not easily forgotten
* Kind, encouraging, and positive words are truly life-giving

---

## Chapter 5: Quality Time

![](QualityTime.jpg style="float: right; width: 11rem")

* sharing quality conversation and quality activities.
* full, undivided attention
* really being there – with the TV off, fork and knife down, and all chores and tasks on standby
  * makes your significant other feel truly special and loved
* Distractions, postponed dates, or the failure to listen can be especially hurtful

## Chapter 6: Receiving Gifts

![](ReceivingGifts.jpg style="float: right; width: 11rem")

Don't mistake this Love Language™ for materialism; the receiver of gifts thrives on the love, thoughtfulness, and effort behind the gift. If you speak this Love Language™, the perfect gift or gesture shows that you are known, you are cared for, and you are prized above whatever was sacrificed to bring the gift to you. A missed birthday, anniversary, or a hasty, thoughtless gift would be disastrous – so would the absence of everyday gestures. Gifts are visual representations of love and are treasured greatly.

## Chapter 7: Acts of Service

![](ActsOfService.jpg style="float: right; width: 11rem")

Can vacuuming the floors really be an expression of love? Absolutely! Anything you do to ease the burden of responsibilities weighing on an "Acts of Service" person will speak volumes. The words he or she most want to hear: "Let me do that for you." Laziness, broken commitments, and making more work for them tell speakers of this Love Language™ their feelings don't matter. Finding ways to serve speaks volumes to the recipient of these acts.

## Love Language #5: Physical Touch

![](PhysicalTouch.jpg style="float: right; width: 11rem")

This Love Language™ isn't all about the bedroom. A person whose primary Love Language™ is Physical Touch is, not surprisingly, very touchy. Hugs, pats on the back, holding hands, and thoughtful touches on the arm, shoulder, or face – they can all be ways to show excitement, concern, care, and love. Physical presence and accessibility are crucial, while neglect or abuse can be unforgivable and destructive. Physical touch fosters a sense of security and belonging in any relationship.
