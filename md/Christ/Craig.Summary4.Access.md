# Access — Who Can Be Saved Through Christ?

## The Question

Having covered the person of Christ (deity and humanity), his atoning death, and his resurrection, Craig turns to the question: who is able to access the benefits of Christ's atoning work? Is Christ the only way of salvation, and if so, what is the fate of those who never hear the Gospel?

## The Biblical Case for Particularism (Part 47)

The New Testament teaches that all people are sinners (Romans 3:9-12), unable to justify themselves through works (Romans 3:19-20), and that salvation comes only through Christ's atoning death received by faith (Romans 3:21-26). Acts 4:12 declares "there is salvation in no one else." This was as scandalous in the polytheistic Roman Empire as it is today.

The "Expansion of Europe" (1450-1750) destabilized confidence in this doctrine. Discovering civilizations that knew nothing of Christianity both relativized religious claims and made Christian exclusivity seem cruel. Religious pluralism -- the view that many roads lead to God -- became the new conventional wisdom.

Craig distinguishes two forms: **unsophisticated pluralism** (all religions are equally true -- refuted by the law of contradiction since religions make mutually exclusive claims) and **sophisticated pluralism** (all religions are equally false but equally effective in transforming lives -- the position of scholars like John Hick). Craig then shows that common arguments for pluralism commit textbook fallacies: the *ad hominem* fallacy (claiming particularists are arrogant) and the *genetic fallacy* (claiming beliefs are invalidated because they're culturally conditioned). Both objections undercut the pluralist's own position as well.

## The Real Problem: The Fate of the Unevangelized (Part 48)

Craig identifies the heart of the issue through John Hick's intellectual journey: if Christ's incarnation and atoning death are the only doorway to eternal life, what about the majority of humanity who never heard? Craig clears away several sub-problems:

- **Would a loving God send anyone to hell?** God desires all to be saved (2 Peter 3:9; 1 Timothy 2:4; Ezekiel 18:23, 32; 33:11). Those who are lost freely and irrevocably reject God's grace. Hell is self-perpetuating because its inhabitants continue sinning.

- **Is eternal punishment unjust?** Each individual sin may deserve finite punishment, but sinning continues forever in hell, accumulating guilt. Moreover, rejecting God himself -- the infinite source of goodness -- is a sin of infinite gravity.

- **Is it unfair to judge people who never heard of Christ?** God judges the unevangelized not on whether they believed in Christ but on their response to general revelation in nature and conscience (Romans 2:7). The benefits of Christ's death can be applied without conscious knowledge of Christ, as with "holy pagans" like Job and Melchizedek. However, Scripture indicates few actually respond properly to general revelation alone.

## The Logical Argument (Part 49)

Craig frames the challenge as a soteriological version of the problem of evil. The pluralist claims these are logically incompatible:

- **A.** God is all-powerful and all-loving.
- **B.** Some people never hear the Gospel and are lost.

The hidden assumptions required to derive a contradiction are:

1. If God is all-powerful, he can create a world where everyone hears the Gospel and is freely saved.
2. If God is all-loving, he prefers a world of universal salvation.

Craig argues neither assumption is necessarily true. Regarding (1): God cannot make someone freely do something -- that is logically impossible. Any feasible world of free creatures may include some who freely reject God. Regarding (2): even if feasible worlds of universal salvation exist, they might have overriding deficiencies (e.g., being sparsely populated) making them less preferable. God can prefer a world with many saved even if it means some are lost.

## The Middle Knowledge Solution (Parts 50-51)

Craig introduces proposition **C**: *God has created a world with an optimal feasible balance between saved and lost, and those who never hear the Gospel and are lost would not have believed it even if they had heard it.*

Using God's middle knowledge -- his knowledge of what every possible person would freely do in any circumstances -- Craig argues God has providentially ordered history so that:

1. **No feasible world of universal salvation may exist.** Given free will, some would freely reject God in any world he could create.
2. **God maximizes the saved and minimizes the lost.** The actual world (past, present, and future) achieves an optimal feasible balance.
3. **No one is lost by accident.** Those who never hear the Gospel would not have believed it even if they had heard it. God places those who would respond to the Gospel at times and places where they do hear it.

Craig finds biblical support in Acts 17:26-27 where Paul says God "determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live" so "that men would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him."

Against the probabilistic objection (that it's improbable all unevangelized would have rejected the Gospel), Craig notes this would be improbable only by happenstance -- but the hypothesis is that a sovereign, omniscient God has providentially arranged the world this way. Since there are no distinguishing sociological or psychological traits that predict who will become a Christian, such providential ordering is empirically indistinguishable from random distribution.

## Practical Implications

Craig argues this view positively motivates missions and evangelism: as Christians share the Gospel, God has foreknown this and placed responsive people in their path. There are "divine appointments" waiting. The compassionate response to religious diversity is not pretending the unevangelized are safe but making every effort to share the Gospel with them.
