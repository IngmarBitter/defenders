# Death — Summary

These lectures develop a multi-faceted doctrine of the atonement with **penal substitution** at the center, supplemented by **propitiation/satisfaction of divine justice**, **redemption**, and **moral influence**. A recurring theme is treating the cross with legal/judicial categories (guilt, punishment, imputation, pardon) without reducing it to a purely “transactional” picture that ignores new creation and sanctification.

## Part 08 — Christ’s Death

Introduces “the work of Christ” via the atonement, and frames the biblical material as a set of complementary motifs rather than a single proof-text. Emphasizes that Christ’s death functions as sacrifice and reconciliation, including themes that later cash out as expiation (dealing with sin) and propitiation (dealing with God’s wrath).

## Part 09 — Propitiatory Sacrifice

Surveys Old Testament sacrificial categories (especially Passover and priestly/temple sacrifices) to explain why propitiation and expiation belong together in biblical atonement language. Sets up how these categories inform New Testament claims about Christ’s blood and sacrifice.

## Part 10 — Christ as Sacrifice

Argues that the New Testament presents Christ as both an expiatory and propitiatory sacrifice (Hebrews, John, Paul), and interacts with the debated term *hilastērion* (propitiation vs expiation). Connects these claims to Isaiah’s suffering servant as the background that unifies sacrifice and substitution.

## Part 11 — Divine Justice (1)

Shifts from sacrifice imagery into judicial/forensic categories: sin is not only corruption but guilt before the Judge. Highlights Isaiah 53’s substitutionary logic and connects it to “the righteousness/justice of God” in Paul, pushing back on reductions that treat justification as merely covenant membership.

## Part 12 — Divine Justice (2)

Continues the justice theme with the language of reckoning/imputation and the logic of representative substitution (union with Christ, Romans 5–6). Distinguishes substitution (Christ acts “instead of”) from representation (Christ acts “on behalf of,” so what happens to him counts for those represented).

## Part 13 — Redemption

Introduces redemption/ransom as liberation from bondage (sin, death, Satan), and treats “ransom” as compatible with (and ultimately dependent on) penal substitution rather than as a standalone rival theory. Proposes constraints any adequate atonement theory should satisfy when reading the Bible’s multiple metaphors.

## Part 14 — Ransom Theory

Explains the patristic ransom/Christus Victor tradition (including the classic “ransom to Satan” and “fishhook” motifs), then critiques it as incomplete if it doesn’t address divine justice. Suggests the victory and liberation elements are real but need integrating with satisfaction/penal categories.

## Part 15 — Satisfaction Theory (Anselm)

Presents Anselm’s *Cur Deus Homo* as a watershed: the atonement is not fundamentally about paying Satan but about making satisfaction to God. Clarifies that Anselm’s core concern is divine justice (not a merely feudal “honor” trope), and introduces the compensation-vs-punishment dilemma: satisfaction can be by compensation (Anselm) or by punishment (Reformers).

## Part 16 — Moral Influence Theory

Explores Abelard’s moral influence account (the cross kindles love and contrition), then argues it’s biblically too thin as a total theory. Notes scholarship suggesting Abelard may also include penal-substitution elements, and concludes “moral influence” works best as one facet of a broader atonement doctrine rather than the whole.

## Part 17 — Penal Substitution (Turretin)

Deepens the Reformational account via Francis Turretin: retributive justice is essential to God’s nature, and satisfaction must address sin as debt, enmity, and crime (so God is creditor, offended party, and Judge). Gives conditions for lawful substitution, argues Christ’s suffering has “infinite value” due to his divine person, and distinguishes forensic imputation (justification) from moral transformation (sanctification).

## Part 18 — Doctrinal Reflection (1): What Is Punishment?

States penal substitution as essential for adequately handling Isaiah 53 and related New Testament usage, then turns philosophical: what counts as punishment, and what justifies punishment? Introduces expressivist definitions (punishment as condemnation/censure) and contrasts retributivism with consequentialism, arguing divine justice is fundamentally retributive.

## Part 19 — Doctrinal Reflection (2): Coherence Objection

Addresses the claim that penal substitution is conceptually incoherent because punishment necessarily condemns the punished, while Christ was sinless. Responds by (a) allowing versions where God “inflicts suffering” without “punishing,” (b) noting expressivism need not condemn the person punished (it can condemn the act), and (c) appealing to legal analogies (strict liability, vicarious liability) plus the doctrine of imputation.

## Part 20 — Doctrinal Reflection (3): Justice Objection

Takes up the central critique: it would be unjust for God to punish an innocent person, so God cannot punish Christ. Discusses how this objection depends on one’s background theory of justice and ethics (including Divine Command Theory), and sets up the need to be more precise about what “retributive justice” requires.

## Part 21 — Doctrinal Reflection (4): Retribution Nuanced + Imputation

Distinguishes positive vs negative retributivism (punish the guilty vs never punish the innocent), and argues the objection often assumes an unqualified negative retributivism that need not be granted. Offers multiple replies: (a) qualified negative retributivism, (b) *prima facie* vs *ultima facie* justice, and (c) most strongly, the imputation of sin—Christ is personally virtuous but legally liable.

## Part 22 — Satisfaction of Divine Justice (1): Propitiation + Guilt

Transitions from expiation to propitiation: how Christ’s death appeases God’s just wrath by satisfying retributive justice. Engages the “unsatisfactoriness” objection by analyzing guilt as a removable liability to punishment, critiques acceptation theories (arbitrary “God could accept anything”), and uses legal analogies (fines, civil penalties, vicarious liability) to show substitution can discharge liability.

Source: [Craig.22.Death_SatisfactionDivJustice1.md](md/Christ/Craig.22.Death_SatisfactionDivJustice1.md)

## Part 23 — Satisfaction of Divine Justice (2): Representation + Pardon

Argues the atonement involves both substitution and representation: Christ is a “proxy” such that his punishment counts as ours (2 Cor 5:14). Prefers grounding this representative union in the incarnation (and baptism) rather than a circular appeal to “mystical union” as a precondition of justification. Reframes divine forgiveness as a legal pardon that can follow satisfaction and can be conditional on repentance/faith.

## Part 24 — Atonement Wrap: Redemption + Moral Influence

Closes the atonement unit by integrating redemption, new creation, justification, and sanctification: atonement is forensic but must be paired with spiritual transformation by the Holy Spirit. Treats ransom as a metaphor for penal substitution, and defends moral influence as real but unintelligible without an objective rescue (Christ actually bears the penalty). Ends with a compact recap of the whole “jewel with many facets” approach to the atonement.
