# The Incarnation: Two Natures, One Person

---

## The Biblical Data

* The New Testament affirms both:
  * **Deity of Christ** (the Son is truly God)
  * **Humanity of Christ** (the Son truly became human)
* Christian orthodoxy insists on both without compromise
  * Deny deity → not Christian theism
  * Deny humanity → not Christian gospel (no true suffering, no true redemption)

---

## Jesus’ True Humanity (Examples)

* Human birth and development
* Temptation and testing
* Physical limitations: hunger, thirst, fatigue
* Mental limitations in his earthly life (for example, knowledge limits)
* Real suffering and death
* Moral growth in human experience (learning obedience through suffering)

---

## The Apparent Contradiction

* How can one person be both:
  * Creator and creature?
  * Infinite and finite?
  * Omniscient and limited?
* The church’s classical confession:
  * “Truly God and truly man”

---

## Historical Controversies (Very High Level)

* After Trinitarian controversies came Christological controversies
* Two broad tendencies:
  * **One-nature** approaches (deity and humanity “mixed”)
  * **Two-nature** approaches (complete deity + complete humanity)
* Representative errors:
  * **Docetism:** Christ only “seemed” human
  * **Apollinarianism:** denies a complete human nature
  * **Nestorian tendencies:** risks splitting Christ into two persons

---

## Chalcedon (451): The Classical Boundary Markers

* One person, two natures
  * “Without confusion, without change”
  * “Without division, without separation”
* Goal: preserve both full deity and full humanity
  * Without turning the incarnation into a contradiction

---

## Craig’s Model (Outline)

* Incarnation is **addition**, not subtraction
  * The Son does not cease to be divine
  * The Son assumes a complete human nature
* Helpful distinctions:
  * Predication “according to” nature
    * Divine predicates by divine nature
    * Human predicates by human nature
  * A “subliminal” divine dimension during the state of humiliation
    * A genuinely human waking consciousness

---

## Practical Takeaways

* The incarnation safeguards:
  * God’s nearness and sympathy in suffering
  * The meaningfulness of Christ’s death (real death)
  * The hope of resurrection (transformed humanity)
* Christology is not abstract
  * It structures worship, prayer, and obedience
