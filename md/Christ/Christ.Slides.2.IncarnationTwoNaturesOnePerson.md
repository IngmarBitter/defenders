# The Incarnation: Two Natures, One Person

---

## The Biblical Data (Non-Negotiables)

* The New Testament affirms both **deity** and **humanity** of Christ
  * The Son is truly God (e.g., John 1:1; Colossians 2:9)
  * The Son truly became human (e.g., John 1:14; 1 John 4:2–3)
* Orthodoxy insists on both without compromise
  * Deny deity → not Christian theism
  * Deny humanity → no real incarnation, no real suffering, no real redemption

---

## Jesus’ True Humanity (Data Points)

* Human birth, growth, and development
* Temptation and testing
* Physical limitations: hunger, thirst, fatigue
* Genuine human psychology and cognition
  * Growth and learning (Hebrews 5:8)
  * Epistemic limits in his earthly consciousness (Mark 13:32)
* Real suffering and real death

---

## The Apparent Contradiction (Incompatible Predicates)

* How can one person be both:
  * Creator and creature?
  * Necessary/eternal and yet mortal?
  * Omniscient and yet “the Son does not know” (Mark 13:32)?
  * Omnipresent and yet bodily located in Palestine?
* The classical confession: **truly God and truly man**
  * Not successive “stages” (God → man → God)
  * Simultaneously divine and human

---

## The Historical Pressure (Errors To Avoid)

* **Docetism:** Christ only “seemed” human
  * No real human life, no real suffering
* **Apollinarianism:** unity preserved by truncating Christ’s humanity
  * The Logos replaces the human rational soul/mind
  * Unity achieved, but at the cost of a complete human nature
* **Nestorian tendency:** full deity + full humanity, but unity threatened
  * Risk: two persons / two Sons
* **Alexandrian (one-nature) tendency:** natures blended/confused
* **Antiochene (two-nature) tendency:** natures kept, but union weakened

---

## Chalcedon (451): Boundary Markers (Not An Explanation)

* The church’s guardrails:
  * **One person** (one Son)
  * **Two complete natures** (truly God and truly man)
  * “Without confusion, without change, without division, without separation”
* What it achieves
  * Rejects Apollinarianism (complete humanity: “rational soul and body”)
  * Rejects Nestorianism (no division into two persons)
* It doesn’t tell us *how* the incarnation works
  * It marks out safe waters for further theorizing

---

## Craig: “Two Natures” Means Natural Kinds

* “Nature” here is a **kind essence** (natural-kind membership)
  * Humanity: the properties that make something human
  * Deity: the properties that constitute divinity
* The Logos possesses:
  * The **divine nature essentially**
  * A **human nature contingently** (assumed in the virginal conception)
* This frames the incarnation as **addition, not subtraction**
  * The Logos does not cease to be God

---

## Against Radical Kenosis (Subtraction)

* Radical kenotic views: the Logos divests divine attributes to become human
* Craig’s objection (in outline)
  * If the Logos gives up essential divine attributes, he ceases to be God
  * God does not “metamorphose” into a man (pagan-style transformation)
* Better reading of Philippians 2 “emptying”
  * A **change of status** (humiliation), not loss of deity

---

## Key Tool: Reduplicative Predication

* Predicates apply to Christ **with respect to** a nature
  * Divine predicates by divine nature
  * Human predicates by human nature
* Examples
  * Christ **died** with respect to his human nature
  * Christ is **omnipresent** with respect to his divine nature
  * Christ **learned obedience** (Hebrews 5:8) with respect to his human nature
  * Christ’s “not knowing” (Mark 13:32) belongs to the human consciousness

---

## Craig’s Proposed Model (Three Planks)

* (1) Chalcedon: **one person** exemplifying **two complete natures**
* (2) A rehabilitated Apollinarian *insight* (handled carefully)
  * A proposal about how unity of person is secured without splitting into two
  * Without denying that Christ’s humanity is complete
* (3) A **subliminal-divine** account during the state of humiliation
  * Divine aspects largely “subliminal”
  * A genuinely human waking consciousness that begins infant-like and grows
  * Not pretense; a real human life

---

## States of Christ: Humiliation → Exaltation

* A common theological distinction
  * **Humiliation:** conception → burial
  * **Exaltation:** resurrection and onward
* Helps read Philippians 2
  * “Emptying” is humility/servanthood (status), not loss of deity

---

## Practical Takeaways (Why This Isn’t “Abstract”) 

* The incarnation safeguards:
  * God’s nearness and sympathy in suffering
  * The meaningfulness of Christ’s death (real death)
  * The hope of resurrection (transformed humanity)
* Christology is not abstract
  * It structures worship, prayer, and obedience
