# Summary — Doctrine of Christ: The Incarnation

This file is a concise synthesis of the `Incarnation` lectures (Parts 1–7).

**Core affirmation**
- Jesus Christ is fully God and fully man: the New Testament affirms both his deity and his true humanity (Philippians 2:5–8; 1 John 4:1–3).

**Scriptural & early historical data**
- The New Testament provides early apostolic traditions concerning Christ's death, burial, resurrection, and appearances (1 Cor 15:3–7). These traditions are extremely early and attest to the central facts the church proclaims.

**Two main Christological questions**
- Who is Jesus? (Person) — the `person` question centers on how deity and humanity coexist in Christ.
- What did Jesus do? (Work) — the `work` question centers on atonement and resurrection (covered in later lectures).

**Historic Christological responses (survey)**
- Apollinarianism (Alexandrian/one-nature tendency): the *Logos* replaces the human rational mind (*nous*). Pros: preserves unity of person; cons: truncates human nature and undermines redemption (condemned).
- Antiochean / Nestorian tendencies: insistence on full human and divine natures but risk of dividing Christ into two persons (condemned).
- Chalcedonian settlement (451): the normative middle way — one person in two complete, distinct natures "without confusion, without change, without division, without separation." This preserves both full deity and full humanity.
- Kenotic proposals: attempts to interpret Philippians 2's "emptying" as divestiture of divine attributes. Craig rejects radical kenosis as incoherent; prefers understanding kenosis as a change of status (humiliation) rather than loss of deity.

**A constructive model (Craig's proposed outline)**
1. Affirm Chalcedon: one person who exemplifies two distinct, complete natures (divine nature essentially, human nature contingently assumed).
2. Rehabilitated Apollinarian insight: the *Logos* functions as the archetypal human *soul* (not to deny a true human nature, but to explain how one person bears both natures—human nature is brought to completeness in union with the *Logos*).
3. Subliminal-divine account: during the state of humiliation, the divine aspects can be largely subliminal (a divine subconscious) while Jesus has a genuine human waking consciousness that grows, is tempted, prays, and is perfected through suffering. This preserves genuine human experience while maintaining the *Logos*' divine identity.

**Key consequences & clarifications**
- Divine and human predicates are properly predicated of Christ with respect to the relevant nature (reduplicative predication): e.g., omniscience of the *Logos* (divine nature) vs. human epistemic limitations in Jesus' earthly consciousness.
- The incarnation is addition (the *Logos* assumes human nature), not subtraction (the *Logos* does not cease to be God).
- The resurrection/glorification is the vindication and transformation of Christ's human nature (and anchors future hope for believers' resurrection bodies).
