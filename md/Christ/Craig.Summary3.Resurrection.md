# Resurrection — Summary

These lectures move from the biblical texts (especially **1 Corinthians 15** and the Gospel narratives) to a structured **historical argument** for the resurrection. Craig organizes the evidence under three "facts to be explained" (empty tomb, post-mortem appearances, and the rise of resurrection belief) and then compares rival explanations, arguing that **"God raised Jesus from the dead"** has superior explanatory scope and power.

## Part 25 — The Resurrection: Paul's Early Tradition (1 Cor 15)

Introduces the resurrection as the "other side" of the cross: it both follows from and publicly ratifies satisfaction of divine justice (Romans 4:25). Walks through 1 Corinthians 15:1–11 and highlights the extremely early creed Paul "received and delivered," emphasizing its Semitic features and its likely origin within a few years of the crucifixion.

## Part 26 — The Creed's Structure + Witness Logic (1 Cor 15:3–5)

Analyzes the four-line structure of the 1 Corinthians 15 tradition and Craig's claim that it lists "witnesses" more than "appearances," functioning as public, checkable testimony. Discusses why women are omitted in Paul's list, and argues that Paul's Damascus Road encounter is treated as a genuine resurrection appearance (not merely a private vision).

## Part 27 — The Resurrection Body (1 Cor 15:35–49)

Explains Paul's analogies (seed/plant, varieties of "flesh," celestial glory) to show continuity through transformation rather than simple reanimation. Clarifies "natural/soulish" vs "spiritual" as *orientation and empowerment* (Spirit-dominated), not "material" vs "immaterial," and warns that "supernatural" may be a less misleading gloss.

## Part 28 — Transformation, Not Body-Swap (1 Cor 15:50–57)

Continues the Adam/Christ contrast and interprets "flesh and blood" as an idiom for mortal human existence rather than a denial of materiality. Argues the resurrection body is the same body transformed (Luke's "flesh and bones" can be harmonized), and uses the "last trumpet" imagery to underscore instantaneous change.

## Part 29 — Burial in Mark: Joseph, Women, Guard Questions

Turns from Paul to the Gospel narratives, beginning with Mark's burial account (Joseph of Arimathea, tomb type, stone). Emphasizes the women's presence as witnesses and begins discussing Matthew's guard tradition (including whether the guard is Roman or Jewish, and how to assess the story historically).

## Part 30 — Mark's Empty Tomb: Purpose, Angel, "Silence," Grave Cloths

Reads Mark 16's empty tomb story and addresses common objections (e.g., "unfinished burial," the women's anointing as devotional practice, and the abrupt ending at 16:8). Surveys harmonization points across Gospels (disciples' inspection, grave cloth details) and revisits the guard issue as a way to understand Jewish/Christian polemic.

## Part 31 — Post-Mortem Appearances (1): Women, Emmaus, Twelve, Sea of Tiberias

Surveys multiple appearance narratives (women, Emmaus road, appearance to the Twelve, Thomas, and John 21). Highlights the "non-recognition" motif as a supernatural inhibition (not a natural mistake) and treats Jesus' wounds and eating as signs of both **corporeality** and **identity** with the crucified Jesus, alongside "supernatural" traits (appearing/vanishing).

## Part 32 — Post-Mortem Appearances (2): Chronology + Women-Appearance Tension

Interprets John 21's Peter dialogue as recommissioning, not rehabilitation, and offers a plausible chronology of appearances tied to Jewish feast pilgrimages. Addresses the Matthew vs John timing tension for the women's appearance by proposing an ordering that preserves all three elements (discovery, inspection, appearance) while explaining Matthew's "leapfrogging."

## Part 33 — Theories (1): Enlightenment Skepticism + Conspiracy Theory (Reimarus)

Introduces modern skepticism as a product of Enlightenment deism and human autonomy, and summarizes Reimarus's claim that the disciples stole the body and fabricated resurrection faith. Notes Reimarus's strategy: reject the guard story, exploit alleged contradictions, and treat prophecy arguments as question-begging.

## Part 34 — Theories (2): Strauss's Mythology + Hallucination and "Vision" Views

Presents Strauss's move from "external facts" to "inner events" and his a priori dismissal of miracles as unhistorical by definition. Introduces modern variants: Lüdemann's subjective-vision (hallucination) approach and Grass/Pannenberg's "objective vision" approach (with Pannenberg pairing visions with the empty tomb), plus the agnostic "interpretation theory" (Spong/Marxsen).

Source: [Craig.34.Resurrection_Theories2.md](md/Christ/Craig.34.Resurrection_Theories2.md)

## Part 35 — Method (1): Existential vs Historical Knowledge + Ehrman's Objection

Distinguishes an "existential" route (encounter with the living Christ) from an "evidential" route (historical inquiry), then outlines a two-step historical argument: establish facts, then infer the best explanation. Critiques Ehrman's claim that historians can't infer miracles by arguing that (a) the evidential facts are not themselves supernatural and (b) explanatory inference does not require direct access to postulated entities.

## Part 36 — Facts (1): Empty Tomb Evidence (1) — Burial → Known Tomb Site

Begins "stage one" by naming three core facts (empty tomb, appearances, origin of belief) and starts the empty tomb case. Argues that if Jesus' burial by Joseph is historical, then the tomb's location was publicly known and the proclamation could not flourish in Jerusalem with an occupied tomb; surveys the burial's very early multiple attestation.

## Part 37 — Facts (2): Empty Tomb Evidence (2) — Multiple Early Independent Sources

Argues that the empty tomb narrative is multiply attested in early sources: pre-Markan passion tradition and the pre-Pauline 1 Cor 15 formula (implicitly "grave-emptying"). Adds independent strands in Matthew (guard tradition), Luke (disciples' inspection), John, and indirect Acts sermon allusions.

## Part 38 — Facts (3): Empty Tomb Evidence (3) — Women + Jewish Polemic

Uses "women as primary witnesses" as an authenticity indicator given first-century attitudes toward women's testimony. Adds the "stolen body" Jewish polemic as hostile evidence presupposing an empty tomb, and portrays the guard story as the endpoint of a developing Jewish/Christian dispute.

## Part 39 — Facts (4): Appearances Evidence (1) — Paul's Eyewitness List

Turns to the post-mortem appearances and argues Paul's list (1 Cor 15:3–8) guarantees that experiences occurred, given his authenticity, proximity to apostles, and invitation to check living witnesses. Develops the appearance to Peter, to the Twelve, to the 500 (likely Galilee), and especially to James as a key explanation of Jesus' family's post-crucifixion conversion.

## Part 40 — Facts (5): Appearances Evidence (2) — Gospel Attestation + Physicality (Paul)

Adds that the Gospels independently attest a wide array of appearance traditions, so the occurrence of appearance experiences is not plausibly a late invention. Begins the "nature of appearances" question: argues Paul's resurrection-body teaching is physical (not immaterial), and that the New Testament conceptually distinguishes visions of the exalted Christ from resurrection appearances.

## Part 41 — Facts (6): Physical Appearances (Gospels) + Origin of Faith

Argues the Gospels unanimously portray physical appearances, which is hard to explain if the originals were only visionary experiences (and anti-Docetic explanations are unpersuasive). Introduces the third fact: Christianity's origin depends on early resurrection belief because crucifixion would have shattered messianic expectations; critiques Bultmann's "exaltation only" move.

## Part 42 — Hypotheses (1): Criteria + Conspiracy / Apparent Death / Wrong Tomb

Introduces McCullagh-style criteria (scope, power, plausibility, ad hocness, fit with background knowledge) and runs classic naturalistic theories through them. Concludes conspiracy and apparent-death accounts are historically and psychologically implausible; rejects "wrong tomb" and "displaced body" as narrow, fragile explanations that collapse once burial/tomb location is public.

Source: [Craig.42.Resurrection_Hypotheses1.md](md/Christ/Craig.42.Resurrection_Hypotheses1.md)

## Part 43 — Hypotheses (2): Myth/Legend vs Early Jewish Context

Treats Strauss/Bultmann-style "myth" as a denial of the empty tomb and a turn to hallucination plus legendary development. Argues against pagan dying-and-rising parallels as both spurious and causally irrelevant in first-century Jewish Palestine, then argues Jewish resurrection beliefs make it unlikely disciples would invent (within history) the resurrection of a single individual prior to the end.

Source: [Craig.43.Resurrection_Hypotheses2.md](md/Christ/Craig.43.Resurrection_Hypotheses2.md)

## Part 44 — Hypotheses (3): Hallucination Hypothesis Critique (Lüdemann)

Argues that even if the tomb were empty and disciples had visions, the natural Jewish interpretation would be translation/assumption into heaven, not resurrection. Critiques hallucination theories for narrow scope (don't explain empty tomb), weak fit with the diversity and group character of appearances, and implausible psychoanalysis of Peter/Paul (including contested readings of Romans 7).

Source: [Craig.44.Resurrection_Hypotheses3.md](md/Christ/Craig.44.Resurrection_Hypotheses3.md)

## Part 45 — Hypothesis: Resurrection as Best Explanation

Runs "God raised Jesus" through the explanatory criteria: it explains all three facts with strong scope and power, and is plausible given natural theology plus Jesus' own life and claims. Defends it against the charge of ad hocness by emphasizing context: a miracle hypothesis here fits better than "miracle-like" alternatives that must postulate moral/medical/psychological anomalies.

Source: [Craig.45.Resurrection_Hypothesis.md](md/Christ/Craig.45.Resurrection_Hypothesis.md)

## Part 46 — Conclusion: How to Share + Five Applications

Clarifies that the "three facts" are a convenient summary of the evidence, not a strict "minimal facts" method (and notes Habermas's near-consensus constraints). Offers five practical implications: the resurrection vindicates Christ's person and atoning work, enables present relationship with the living Lord, grounds hope in death, promises physical and psychological healing, and guarantees Christ's bodily return.
