# Christ’s Death: Penal Substitution Defended

---

## Penal Substitution (Center of Gravity)

* “Substitution” and “representation” belong together
  * Christ acts **in our place** and **on our behalf**
* Legal themes Craig stresses:
  * Guilt as liability
  * Satisfaction of justice
  * Pardon and justification

---

## Why the Objections Matter

* Many reject penal substitution as:
  * Conceptually incoherent
  * Morally unjust
  * Theologically “transactional”
* Craig’s approach:
  * Clarify what punishment is
  * Clarify what justice requires
  * Use careful legal analogies (without reducing atonement to civil law)

---

## Objection 1: “Punishment Implies Condemnation”

* If punishment inherently condemns the person punished
  * Then Christ cannot be punished (he is sinless)
* Replies often include:
  * Punishment as condemnation of the act, not the person
  * Distinguishing “inflicting suffering” from “punishing” (depending on theory)
  * Imputation / legal liability without personal wickedness

---

## Objection 2: “It’s Unjust to Punish the Innocent”

* The challenge is fundamentally about a theory of justice
  * Especially retributive justice
* Key moves in the response:
  * Qualified negative retributivism (not an absolute prohibition)
  * Representation: Christ is a public person for those he saves
  * Imputation: legal guilt can be transferred by divine act

---

## Satisfaction, Forgiveness, and Pardon

* Atonement can be framed as satisfaction that makes pardon possible
  * Not “God is forced”
  * Rather: God acts consistently with his justice and mercy
* Forgiveness is not denial of guilt
  * It is a grounded pardon that can be conditional on repentance and faith

---

## Practical Takeaways

* Christ’s death:
  * Shows the seriousness of sin
  * Shows God’s love in giving himself
  * Grounds assurance (objective basis)
  * Calls for transformed living (sanctification)
