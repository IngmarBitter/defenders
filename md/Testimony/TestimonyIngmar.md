**My Testimony -- Ingmar Bitter**

Before Jesus
============
I grew up believing that modern science could answer all of life’s important questions. Through high school and university—where I studied physics, chemistry, and computer science leading to a PhD—I was taught that *Darwinian Evolution* and *The Big Bang* were universally accepted facts, and therefore saw no need for God to explain our world. Still, I could imagine God existing in some sort of “fourth dimension” beyond the reach of scientific methods. I recognized the benefit Christians enjoyed by believing in God as a source of strength and inner peace. However, merely being told He exists was never enough for me, as it came without any satisfying evidence. So I prayed and asked God that, if He truly exists, He would grant me a personal miracle to confirm His presence. When nothing obvious happened, I went on with my life and ignored the issue.

Getting to know Jesus
=====================
Everything changed when I met my soon-to-be wife, Joviette. I could see Jesus reflected in her actions and began attending church with her every Sunday so I wouldn’t miss an opportunity to spend time with her. Through these church visits, I was exposed more thoroughly to the gospel and eventually decided the Christian message was too good to dismiss. I truly wanted to believe it and become part of God’s family. So **I asked Jesus to forgive me for my wrongdoings, to come into my heart, and to be my Lord and Savior. I thanked Him for dying on the cross for me and committed to following His lead. I was baptized the very next Sunday.** Despite this, I still wrestled with doubts because of my scientific background.

Some time later, I encountered Christian scientists who insisted the Bible is correct, while evolution and the Big Bang are over-extrapolated theories. Intrigued, I studied several books and DVDs on the subject and followed many internet discussions. I discovered that a significant amount of evidence conflicts with both the Big Bang and evolutionary theory—evidence never mentioned in my education or in popular media. In contrast, creation science provided coherent explanations for these same observations.

I realized that genuinely applying the scientific method to all the data neither removes the need for a creator of the universe nor the need for a designer of life’s complexity on earth. In fact, it requires a great deal of blind faith to assume these realities can be explained away without God. It seemed far more rational to believe in God’s miraculous hand in physics and biology, just as Genesis describes. This, in fact, turned out to be the answer to my prayer for a miraculous sign of His existence. Further study convinced me that the Bible is more likely a true divine revelation than any other religious scripture. As a result, I was finally able to overcome my doubts and **place my complete trust in Jesus, confident in His love for me, most powerfully shown when He gave His life on the cross to pay the penalty for my sin—guilt - so that I can live guilt-free and enjoy eternal life with Him.**

Maturing as a Christian
=======================
Eager to learn more about God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit, I joined an adult Sunday school class and an evening evangelism course. I sought opportunities to share God’s wonderful plan with coworkers and friends. I also asked more mature Christians to mentor me on my journey with Jesus. They discussed the questions I was struggling with and recommended books for further study.

Reflecting on life’s meaning and purpose, I realized how clearly they are defined for Christians, yet depressingly absent for non-believers. Fortunately, I hadn’t dwelt on these questions much before trusting Jesus and thus avoided a possible midlife crisis. I also noticed that I became more content and thankful for the ways both, God and people, had blessed me.

At my church, I joined the worship team as a drummer and prepared to teach others what I had learned about God and science, sharing it with both adults and youth. In 2011, I was voted in as an elder and began helping to lead the congregation.

To better equip myself to teach Christian doctrine, I completed two four-year courses in Systematic Theology and Apologetics, which I then taught at our church. Next, I began speaking publicly about God by giving talks on science and faith at York University and the University of Toronto.

Today, I serve at Creekside Christian Church, helping fellow Christians gain the same confidence and joy that I experience.
