**My Testimony -- Ingmar Bitter**

Before Jesus
============
I grew up in an environment that presented modern science as capable of answering all of life's important questions. Through high school and university, where I studied physics, chemistry, and computer science leading to a PhD degree, I was presented with _Darwinian Evolution_ and _The Big Bang_ as universally accepted facts, leaving me with no need for a God to explain this world. However, I could imagine God in some sort of fourth dimension inaccessible to scientific methods. I could see the benefit Christians enjoyed through having belief in God as a source of strength and inner peace. Nevertheless, someone just telling me He exists was not sufficient for me to believe as it never was accompanied by any satisfying evidence. So I asked God that, if He really exists, He would grant me a personal miracle making it obvious to me that He exists. As nothing obvious happened, I went on with my life ignoring the topic.

Getting to know Jesus
=====================
This was until I met my to-be wife, Joviette. I could see Jesus reflected in her actions. I also went to church with her every Sunday to not miss an opportunity to spend time with her. Through that, I got a lot more exposure to the gospel and eventually decided that the Christian message was too good to ignore. I really wanted to believe it and to be part of God's family. So **I asked Jesus to forgive me for my wrongdoings, to come into my heart and be my Lord and Savior. I thanked Him that He died for me on the cross and committed to following His lead. I was baptized the next Sunday**. However, I was still having a lot of doubts because of my scientific education.

Sometime later, I heard from Christian scientists that the Bible is correct and that evolution and the big bang are over-extrapolated theories. That got me very interested. I proceeded to study several books and DVDs on this topic and followed several internet discussions. I found out that there are a ton of evidences that do not fit at all with the big bang and evolution theory. Interestingly, those were never mentioned during my education or in the media. In contrast, creation science has very useful explanations for those same evidences. I saw that honestly applying the scientific method to all the evidences does neither remove the need for a creator of the universe nor the need for a designer of the complexity in life on earth. It actually requires a lot of irrational blind faith to believe that those can be explained away. It is much more rational to believe in Godâ€™s miraculous hand in physics and biology as described in Genesis. This was, in fact, the answer to my prayer to God giving me a miraculous sign of His existence. Together with further studies that showed me that the Bible is more likely to be true Godly revelation than any other religious scripture, I was finally able to overcome my doubts and **fully trust in Jesus and have true confidence in His love for me, which He expressed most importantly by giving His life on the cross to pay the penalty for my sin guilt - so that I can be guilt-free and have eternal life with Him**. 

Maturing as a Christian
=======================
After that, I was eager to learn more about God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. I joined an adult Sunday school class and evening classes on evangelism. I looked for opportunities to share God's wonderful plan with co-workers and friends. I then asked more mature Christians to be my mentors in my continued path to follow Jesus. They discussed with me questions that I was struggling with and recommended books to read.

As I reflected on the meaning and purpose of life, I saw they are clear and present for Christians, but non-existent for non-believers and thus depressing. Luckily, I had not thought about it much before trusting Jesus and therefore escaped a looming midlife crisis. I also realized that I was more content with my life and more thankful for the various ways people and God blessed me.

In my church, I joined the worship team to play drums and prepared what I had learned about God and science so that I could teach it to the adults as well as the youth in the church. In 2011, I was voted in as an Elder and started helping to lead the congregation.

To better equip myself for teaching Christian doctrine, I worked through two four-year Systematic Theology and Apologetics courses which I then proceeded to teach at our church.

Next, I started to speak up for God publically by giving several talks on science and faith organized by Power to Change at York University and at University of Toronto.

And now I am helping at Creekside Christian Church to give fellow Christians the same confidence and joy that I am experiencing.
