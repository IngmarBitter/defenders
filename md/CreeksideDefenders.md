**Creekside Defenders**


!!!
   ”Always be ready to give a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you. 
   However, do this with gentleness and respect” 1 Peter 3:15 HCSB

Three Class Purposes
====================

[x] To train Christians to understand, articulate, and defend basic Christian truths

Class Content
================
