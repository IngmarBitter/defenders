## Definition of Authority

![](revelation101Pics/Authority.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Authority means the right to demand belief and obedience
* Familiar authorities in human affairs: state, parents, employers
* These authorities have derivative power and limited spheres
* God's authority is ultimate and unlimited
* No higher court of appeal from God's authority
* God speaks authoritatively on all matters

---

## Authority in Christian Theology

![](revelation101Pics/BibleGlow.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Key question: Who has the authority to speak about God and our relationship to him?
* Sacred Scripture or the church?
* Or #3: Authority ultimately is only in God himself
* Any other authority is derivative from God
* God is the author of Scripture and guides the church
* God has the ability to speak authoritatively about himself and his truth

---

## Discovering God's Will

![](revelation101Pics/Meditate.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Practical question: How do we discover God’s will and mind?
* How do we know what God thinks and wants us to do?
* Answer: Revelation
* God has revealed his will and mind to us
* Revelation is not just the book of the Bible, but God revealing his truth and himself

---

## Meaning of Revelation "ἀποκάλυψις" (apokalypsis)

![](revelation101Pics/RevelationMeaning.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* "ἀποκάλυψις" (apokalypsis) - Greek
  * Revelation
  * Unveiling something hidden
  * The disclosure or discovery of hidden things
  * Allows us to see and know matters for what they are

---

## Propositional Revelation

![](revelation101Pics/BibleLight.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Scripture is typically thought to be God’s propositional revelation
  * Revelation in the form of sentences, i.e. those in the Bible
* Not all of Scripture is a revelation in the sense of unveiling hidden things
  * Early biblical critics struggled with this concept
  * Much of the Bible is was common knowledge
    * e.g. Luke interviewed regular people

---

## Two Senses of Revelation

![](revelation101Pics/TwoViews.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Narrow sense: Unveiling something previously unknown
  * Not all of the New Testament is a revelation in this sense
  * Examples: Book of Revelation, New Testament prophets
* Broader sense: Communication from God
  * Scripture as God’s Word to us, even if it uses historical sources and mundane knowledge

---

## General vs. Special Revelation

![](revelation101Pics/NatureAndBible.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Two kinds of revelation: General and special
* General revelation: Generally available to mankind as a whole
  * Universal and provides general knowledge about God
* Special revelation: Specific information about God
  * Requires God to tell us explicitly

---

## Acts 14:15-17 on General Revelation

![](revelation101Pics/nature.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    15 Men, why are you doing this? We also are men, of like nature with you, preaching to you to turn from these vain things to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth, the sea, and all things that are in them. 16 In past generations He allowed all nations to walk in their own ways. 17 Yet He did not leave Himself without witness, for He did good and gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying our hearts with food and gladness.
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em;">
    <em>Acts 14:15-17 (MEV)</em>
</p>

* Seasons and fruitfulness of nature as evidence of God
* Even Gentile nations had evidence of God through general revelation

---

## Psalm and Romans on General Revelation

![](revelation101Pics/nebula.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    1 The heavens declare the glory of God; the firmament shows His handiwork.
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em;">
    <em>Psalm 19:1 (MEV)</em>
</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    18 The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who **suppress the truth** through unrighteousness. 19 For **what may be known about God is clear** to them since God has shown it to them. 20 **The invisible things about Him—His eternal power and deity—have been clearly seen since the creation of the world and are understood by the things that are made, so that they are without excuse**.
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em;">
    <em>Romans 1:18-20 (MEV)</em>
</p>

---

## Romans on General Revelation (part II)

![](revelation101Pics/greeks.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    14 When Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, although they do not have the law, are a law unto themselves, 15 who show the work of **the law written in their hearts**, their consciences also bearing witness, while **their conflicting thoughts accuse or excuse them**, 16 in the day when, according to my gospel, God will judge the secrets of men through Jesus Christ.
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em;">
    <em>Romans 2:14-16 (MEV)</em>
</p>

---

## General Revelation in Nature and Conscience

![](revelation101Pics/HeartScale.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Nature: Romans 1:18-20: invisible nature perceived in creation
  * All men are responsible for recognizing the Creator
  * Awe of God’s power and majesty through beauty and grandeur of the universe
  * People are without excuse for acknowledging God’s existence
* Conscience: Romans 2:14-16: moral law written on our hearts
  * Even Gentiles understand right and wrong
  * All accountable to moral law written on their hearts

---

## Responsibility and Knowledge

![](revelation101Pics/MeditateAngel.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* All persons are held responsible for:
  * Believing in an eternal, powerful Creator of the universe
  * Recognizing the demands of his moral law upon their lives
* Question: Does general revelation provide sufficient information for a saving knowledge of God?

---

## Can General Revelation be Redemptive?

![](revelation101Pics/GodJudge.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

1. Limited Purpose: Show just God's grandeur and power
  * Not to provide redemptive knowledge of God
2. Extended Purpose: provide a law
   * When there is no law, there is no sin and thus no condemnation
   * When there is some law, there is accountability to what's known
   * Gentiles are condemned for not living up to general revelation, being in awe of God and acting morally

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif; margin-top: -0.5em;">
    15 Because the law produces wrath; for where there is no law, there is no sin.
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.5em;">
    <em>Romans 4:15 (MEV)</em>
</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif; margin-top: -1em;">
    15 ... the law written in their hearts ... their conflicting thoughts accuse or excuse them ...
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.5em;">
    <em>Romans 2:15 (MEV)</em>
</p>

## General Revelation can be Redemptive!

![](revelation101Pics/GodJudge.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Responding positively to general revelation can avoid condemnation
  * General revelation serves as a channel to know & trust God
  * Salvation through Christ, even without knowing Christ
  * Old Testament saving faith: Abraham, Moses, King David
  * Gentiles with saving faith: Job, Melchizedek, King Abimelech
* Few people outside the OT are saved this way
  * Requires seeing the law and **repentance** for breaking it
  * Requires trusting God for a way to **forgive our sins**
  * Requires **not trusting false gods** for alternative salvation
* **Hearing the gospel** is a much easier way to access **salvation**

---

## Functions of General Revelation

![](revelation101Pics/GenRevFunctions.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Render people culpable before God
* Provide access to salvation (though rarely accessed)
* Stabilize human society by providing a moral framework
  * Mutual agreement on human worth and societal functioning
  * Example: Chinese philosophers advocating Christianity for societal stability

---

## Natural Theology and Special Revelation

![](revelation101Pics/BibleNature.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Relationship of general revelation to natural theology
* Natural theology: Justification for God’s existence apart from authoritative divine revelation
* Explores what can be known about God based on human reason alone
* Constructs arguments for God’s existence

---

## Relationship Between General Revelation and Natural Theology

![](revelation101Pics/NatureReason.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* General revelation: Traits of the artist in his artifact
* Natural theology: Human formulations of arguments for God’s existence
* Arguments are fallible and revisable
* General revelation is clear and renders all men inexcusable

---

## Romans 1 and Natural Theology

![](revelation101Pics/BibleGlobe.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Romans 1:18-20 ... clearly seen and understood ...
  * Is both, perception and inference to the best explanation
  * We will study this in depth
* Is similar to Greek philosophy: God can be known through creation
* Is similar to Jewish *The Wisdom of Solomon* 13:1-9
  * Men are without excuse for not recognizing the Creator
  * Reflection on creation leads to knowledge of God
  * Folly to worship the works themselves instead of the Creator

---

## Special Revelation

![](revelation101Pics/BibleJesusSleep.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Special revelation: More clear and fuller than general revelation
* Types of special revelation:
  1. Jesus Christ (the living Word)
  2. Holy Scripture (the written Word)
  3. Particular revelations (dreams, visions, prophecies)

---

## Jesus Christ as Special Revelation

![](revelation101Pics/JesusBooks.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
    14 The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, the glory as the only Son of the Father, full of grace and truth.
    18 No one has seen God at any time. The only Son, who is at the Father’s side, has made Him known.
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em;">
    <em>John 1:1,14,18 (MEV)</em>
</p>

* John 1:1, 14, 18: Jesus as the Word of God
* Full revelation of God’s grace and truth in human flesh

---

## Holy Scripture as Special Revelation

![](revelation101Pics/BibleCross.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    16 All Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness,
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em;">
    <em>2 Timothy 3:16 (MEV)</em>
</p>

* 2 Timothy 3:16: Scripture is inspired by God
* Profitable for teaching, reproof, correction, and training in righteousness

---

## Particular Revelations

![](revelation101Pics/priestDiscussion.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* 1 Corinthians 14:26, 29-30: Prophecies and revelations in the New Testament church
* Particular revelations are not universally applicable
* Intended for specific times, places, and persons
* Was useful before the NT was written
* Is useful where there is no NT: Muslims coming to Christ through visions
* Discernment is crucial (1 John 4:1)
<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif; margin-top: -1em;">
    1 Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em;"><em>1 John 4:1 (MEV)</em></p>
