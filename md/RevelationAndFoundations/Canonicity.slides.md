## Canonicity Concept

![](CanonicityPics/BooksOnScale.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **Canon definition**
  * Rule or standard
  * The set of books that are inspired by God
* **Importance of canonicity**
  * Determines which books are God's Word
* **Other books**
  * May have good history and wisdom, but are not on the same level of trustworthiness and inerrancy
  * Not directly God's message to us

## Old Testament Canonicity

  * Inconsistencies with *Tanakh* (prayers for the dead, purgatory)
* **Early church fathers' rejection**
  * Many early Christian leaders did not accept them as Scripture
* **Council of Trent (AD 1546): Roman Catholic Church included them**
  * Protestant Reformers rejected them

## New Testament Canonicity II

![](CanonicityPics/LightOnWords.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    9 For you remember, brethren, our labor and toil; for laboring night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God. 10 You are witnesses, and God also, how devoutly and justly and blamelessly we behaved ourselves among you who believe; 11 as you know how we exhorted, and comforted, and charged every one of you, as a father does his own children, 12 that you would walk worthy of God who calls you into His own kingdom and glory. 13 For this reason we also thank God without ceasing, because when **you received the word of God which you heard from us, you welcomed it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God**, which also effectively works in you who believe.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>1 Thessalonians 2:9-13 (NKJV, emphasis added)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">

</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Galatians 1:11-12 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Apostles' conviction

  * A revelation from Jesus Christ

---

## New Testament Canonicity IV

![](CanonicityPics/GlowWriting.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    36 Or did the word of God come originally from you? Or was it you only that it reached? 37 If anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things which I write to you are the commandments of the Lord.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>1 Corinthians 14:36-37 (NKJV)</em></p>

## Early Acceptance of New Testament Books

![](CanonicityPics/BibleDemonstrated.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    15 and consider that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation—as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, has written to you, 16 as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which untaught and unstable people twist to their own destruction, as they do **also the rest of the Scriptures**.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>2 Peter 3:15-16 (NKJV, emphasis added)</em></p>

* 2 Peter 3:15-16
  * Paul's letters as Scripture
  * On the same level as *OT* scripture
* Sub-apostolic church fathers (e.g., Ignatius, Polycarp)
  * Distinguished their writings from apostolic writings

## Criteria for Canonicity

![](CanonicityPics/BooksOnScale.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **God’s Middle Knowledge guided the canon’s formation**
* **Apostolic origin**
  * Written by apostles or their associates, chosen by God
* **Consistency with other canonical books**
  * Aligned with God’s unified revelation
* **Recognition by the early church**
  * Affirmed through divine oversight over time
* **Temporarily disputed books resolved**
  * *James, Jude, 2 Peter, 2 & 3 John*

---

## Temporarily Disputed Books: James

![](CanonicityPics/WorldWords.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **Authorship**
  * Initial uncertainty if the author was *James*, the brother of Jesus, or another *James*
    * *James*, the brother of Jesus, accepted as the author based on historical and traditional evidence
* **Theological Concerns**
  * Some early Christians were concerned that *James'* emphasis on works might contradict Paul's teachings on justification by faith alone
    * Resolved by understanding *James'* emphasis on works as evidence of faith, not salvation by works.

---

## Temporarily Disputed Books: Jude

![](CanonicityPics/WorldWords.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **Authorship**
  * The author identifies himself as *Jude*, the brother of *James*, but there was uncertainty about which *James* he referred to.
    * Identification of *Jude* as the brother of *James* (and likely the brother of Jesus) became widely accepted.
* **Content**
  * *Jude* quotes from non-canonical sources like the Book of Enoch, which raised questions about its appropriateness for inclusion in the canon.
    * Use of non-canonical sources understood as literary devices, not endorsements as also inspired.

---

## Temporarily Disputed Books: 2 Peter

![](CanonicityPics/WorldWords.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **Authorship**
  * There were doubts about whether the apostle *Peter* actually wrote this letter, as the style and vocabulary differ significantly from 1 *Peter*.
    * Differences in style and vocabulary attributed to different circumstances and purposes of writing.
* **Late Acceptance**
  * 2 *Peter* was one of the last books to be widely accepted into the canon, partly due to the authorship concerns.
    * Sufficient historical and traditional support for *Peter's* authorship found over time.

---

## Temporarily Disputed Books: 2 & 3 John

![](CanonicityPics/WorldWords.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **Authorship**
  * While traditionally attributed to the apostle *John*, the letters are very brief and do not explicitly name the author, leading to some uncertainty.
    * Stylistic and thematic similarities with the Gospel of *John* supported traditional attribution to the apostle *John*.
* **Limited Circulation**
  * These letters were not as widely circulated or known in the early church, which contributed to the delay in their acceptance.
    * Wider circulation and recognition affirmed their apostolic origin and theological consistency.

---

## Disputed Books Conclusion

![](CanonicityPics/BibleGlows.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Early doubts resolved through:
  * Apostolic authorship confirmed (James, Jude, 2 Peter, 2 & 3 John)
  * Consistency with undisputed books
  * Widespread church acceptance over time
* Strengthens trust in the final NT canon

---

## Canonicity Conclusion

![](CanonicityPics/ChurchBuiltOnBooks.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **Canonicity secures the Bible’s authority as God’s Word**
* **The Holy Spirit, with Middle Knowledge guided the process**:
  * Inspired apostles to write (John 14:26)
  * Directed the church to recognize true Scripture
* **Across OT and NT, the canon emerged through**:
  * Apostolic/prophetic origin
  * Consistency across all books
  * Universal acceptance despite early disputes
* **Today’s Bible stands as God’s fully inspired revelation**
