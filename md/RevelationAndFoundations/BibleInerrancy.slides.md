## Review of Bible Inspiration

![](InspirationPics/BibleAndCandles.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Bible Inspiration is
  * Plenary
    * All of the Bible
  * Verbal
    * Each word in the original language
    * Translation differences matter
    * But are not dealbreakers
  * Confluent
    * Synergetic between God and man
    * The Bible is God's message to mankind revealed through human authors in Scripture
      * Molinism and middle-knowledge provide a viable model

---

## Authority of Scripture

![](InspirationPics/1Tim316.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* God has absolute divine authority
* God speaks with divine authority
* God's Word carries divine authority
* The Bible is God's word to us
* => We ought to believe the Bible as true and thus inerrant
  * What does inerrant mean?

---

## Defining Biblical Inerrancy

![](InspirationPics/OrchestratedBeauty.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Not everything in the Bible is true on all levels
  * e.g., true records of false statements by Job's friends
* **Inerrancy: Bible is truthful in all it affirms or teaches**
  * Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy, 1978

---

## Chicago Statement Highlights

![](InspirationPics/BibleWithBeauty.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy, 1978
  * Holy Scripture is plenary, verbal and confluent
    * Written by men prepared and superintended by His Spirit
  * Infallible divine authority in all matters it affirms, commands, and promises.
  * Inerrant, without error or fault in all its teaching, incl. God, creation, history, Jesus and salvation

---

## Infallibility and Inerrancy

![](InspirationPics/ScrollDifferences.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Infallible: Reliable guide to morality, wisdom, and salvation (will not fail you)
* Inerrant: Free from all falsehood or mistake (will not teach you errors)
* Scripture is entirely true and trustworthy in all its assertions
* Nuanced and subtle doctrine
  * NOT: Everything is literally true
  * Requires interpretation and understanding of the original text
  * What do the biblical authors really mean to affirm or teach?

---

## Teaching vs. Saying

![](InspirationPics/LightOnWords.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    30 Then He said, “To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? Or with what parable shall we picture it? 31 It is like a **mustard seed** which, when it is sown on the ground, is **smaller than all the seeds on earth**; 32 but when it is sown, it grows up and becomes greater than all herbs, and shoots out large branches, so that the birds of the air may nest under its shade.”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em;">    <em>Mark 4:30-32 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Inerrancy in what it teaches, not just what it says
* Example: Parable of the Mustard Seed (Mark 4:30-32)
  * Not botany, but hyperbole to illustrate the Kingdom of God

---

## Literary Conventions and Inerrancy

![](InspirationPics/WorldWords.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Literary conventions and styles in the Bible
  * History, poetry, wisdom
  * Hyperbole, metaphor, generalization, approximation
  * Chronology, reordering, paraphrase
  * Precision expectation much more flexible at the time
* Hermeneutics
  * Interpret scripture considering authors' intent, audience, culture
  * and all of the literary nuances above
  * => Needed to discern the infallible and inerrant Bible teachings

---

## Jesus' Attitude Toward the Scriptures

![](InspirationPics/BibleAndCandles.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    6 I said, “You are gods, And all of you are children of the Most High.”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em;">    <em>Psalms 82:6 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    34 Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in your law, ‘I said, you are gods’? 35 If He called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be broken), 36 do you say of Him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’?”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em;">    <em>John 10:34-36 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Jesus quotes Psalms 82:6 in John 10:34-36
* Refers to it as the Word of God
* "Scripture cannot be broken" - reliable and true

---

## Inductive vs. Deductive Reasoning

![](InspirationPics/BibleGuarded.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Inerrancy not based on inductive reasoning (can't find errors, thus error-free)
* Based on Jesus' attitude toward the Hebrew Scriptures
* Jesus called them the Word of God, reliable and true
* We believe His teachings, incl. this one on scripture

---

## Deductive Argument for Inerrancy

* A1: Whatever God teaches is true
  * God is morally perfect and not a deceiver
* A2. Historical, prophetic, and other evidences show that Jesus is God
  * Apologetic arguments and Christian evidences
* A3. Therefore, whatever Jesus teaches is true

* B1. Whatever Jesus teaches is true
* B2. Jesus taught that the Scriptures are the inerrant Word of God
* B3. Therefore, the Scriptures are the inerrant Word of God

<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: 1em;">    <em>Thoughts on the case for Biblical Inerrancy?</em></p>

## Challenges to Biblical Inerrancy

![](InspirationPics/BibleDemonstrated.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Inconsistencies within Scripture
  * Adam & Eve creation timing <small>(Gen 1 and Gen 2)</small>
  * Judas Iscariot's cause of death <small>(Matt 27:5 and Acts 1:18)</small>
* Factual mistakes
  * The mustard seed is the smallest seed <small>(Mark 4:31)</small>
  * King Sargon II unknown <small>(Isa 20:1)</small>
* Ethical errors
  * The command to kill the Canaanites <small>(Deut 20:16-17)</small>
  * The acceptance of slavery <small>(Eph 6:5)</small>
  * No homosexual relations <small>(Rom 1:26-27)</small>
* => What is the worst impact these challenges could have?

---

## Inerrancy in the Web of Christian Beliefs

![](InspirationPics/ScrollWithCorrections.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Our web of beliefs in decreasing order of significance
  1. Existence of God, Jesus and salvation
  2. Nature of God, Trinity
  3. Moral law, Communion, baptism
  4. Creation, original sin, tribulation, rapture
  5. Inspiration
  6. Infallibility
  7. Inerrancy
     * Nothing else depends on it
     * => Christianity is not lost IF inerrancy is lost, but is it?

---

## Inconsistencies within Scripture

* Two accounts of the same story with details that appear inconsistent
* Hermeneutics can resolve most
* Harmonization can resolve most of the remainder
* Postponing the final remainder is acceptable

---

## Hermeneutics: Ancient Writing Techniques

* Compression (telescoping)
  * Narrative compacted into a shorter form
* Displacement
  * Moving a passage to a different chronological position in the story
* Paraphrasing
  * Direct quotes were invented much later (17th century)
  * Direct and indirect speech are not distinguished
* Redaction
  * For emphasis on remainder
* These techniques are the reason for most apparent inconsistencies within the Bible

---

## Hermeneutics: Adam & Eve Creation Timing

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -2em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Genesis 1:27 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being. And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place. Then the rib which the Lord God had taken from man He made into a woman, and He brought her to the man.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Genesis 2:7, 21-22 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Were Adam and Eve created together or in sequence?
* Hermeneutics resolves the inconsistency
  * Gen 1 is a general overview of creation
  * Gen 2 is a detailed account of the creation of man and woman
  * Different perspectives and purposes of the two accounts

---

## Harmonizing Difficulties

* Harmonization is a possible story that ties all details together
  * Might seem far fetched, but so does reality:
    * Dr Kenneth Kantzer's was informed by two reliable sources that
      * His mother was hit by bus and both rushed to hospital
      * His mother died instantaneously in car accident
        * How can they both be true?
        * On the way to the hospital the ambulance had an accident and his mother was killed in that ambulance accident
* Harmonization does not try to provide the real story
* Does refute the claim "There is no way both could be true"

---

## Harmonizing: Judas Iscariot's Cause of Death

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em;">    <em>Matthew 27:5 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -2em;">    <em>Acts 1:18 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Harmonization
  * Judas hanged himself from a tree in the field
  * Started to decompose
  * Rope tore or was cut
  * He fell and burst open

---

## Holding the Truth in Tension

* Sometimes we must hold seemingly contradictory truths in tension
* Trusting that further understanding or revelation will resolve the tension
* Faith in the reliability and truthfulness of Scripture despite apparent contradictions

---

## Conclusion on Inconsistencies within Scripture

* Inconsistencies often arise from different perspectives or purposes
* Hermeneutics can resolve many apparent inconsistencies
* Harmonization can provide plausible explanations for remaining issues
* Faith in the overall reliability and truthfulness of Scripture is maintained
* Postponing final resolution is acceptable when necessary

<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: 1em;">    <em>Thoughts on Inconsistencies within Scripture?</em></p>

---

## Factual Mistakes

* Factual Mistakes: Details not correct according to contemporary knowledge
* Hermeneutics can show that the detail was not intended as literal fact
  * E.g. The mustard seed is the smallest seed (Mark 4:30-32, see above)
    * Not world wide botany fact, but hyperbole to illustrate the Kingdom of God
* Contemporary extra Biblical knowledge can be wrong and revised
  * Knowledge of the ancient world is sketchy
    * E.g. King Sargon II, next slide

---

## King Sargon II

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him, and he fought against Ashdod and took it.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em;">    <em>Isaiah 20:1 (NKJV)</em></p>

* King Sargon II mentioned in the Bible
* No trace in ancient history initially
* => Classified as likely Bible error
* Archaeologists unearthed Sargon II's palace in Khorsabad in 1843
* Now know more about Sargon II than any other ancient Assyrian king

---

## Conclusion on Factual Mistakes

* Hope that future discoveries will resolve tensions
* Ongoing pattern of biblical accuracy being confirmed
* Faith in the reliability of Scripture despite apparent discrepancies

<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: 1em;">    <em>Thoughts on Factual Mistakes?</em></p>

---

## Ethical Errors: Killing of the Canaanites

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    But of the cities of these peoples which the Lord your God gives you as an inheritance, you shall let nothing that breathes remain alive,
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em;">    <em>Deuteronomy 20:16 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Commanded to not remain men, women, and children alive in Canaan
  * Challenges God's character as loving
  * Often called the *slaughter* of the Canaanites
* Was not a *slaughter*, as they did fight back
* Was not a *genocide*, as they were allowed no leave instead of fight
* Was deserved punishment for child sacrificing savages
* Was salvation for the infants otherwise growing up to go to hell
* => Was morally blameless

---

## Ethical Errors: Slavery

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    Bondservants, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in sincerity of heart, as to Christ;
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Ephesians 6:5 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Acceptance of slavery
  * Challenges God's character as just
* Not slaves at all, but bondservants. (NKJV translates correctly)
  * Voluntary servanthood to guarantee food and shelter for family
* Not necessarily God's ideal will, but best given the circumstances
  * Jesus on divorce, "because of your hardness of hearts Moses allowed"
  * Ideal in Genesis: He made man in God's image. All of us with equal value and dignity

---

## Ethical Errors: Homosexual Relations

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    For this reason God gave them up to vile passions. For even their women exchanged the natural use for what is against nature. Likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust for one another, men with men committing what is shameful, and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em;">    <em>Romans 1:26-27 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Prohibition of homosexual relations
  * Contrary to secular moral values
* Secular moral values are not the gold standard
* Must stand our ground that God is standard
* Thus not a moral error, but reason for moral correction
* => Prohibition of homosexual relations is morally blameless

---

## Conclusion on Ethical Errors

* Ethical errors often arise from misunderstandings of cultural context and divine intent
* Hermeneutics can resolve many apparent ethical issues
* Faith in the overall moral integrity and truthfulness of Scripture is maintained

<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: 1em;">    <em>Thoughts on Ethical Errors?</em></p>

---

## Conclusion on Bible Inerrancy

![](InspirationPics/InspirationBook.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* The Bible is authoritative and truthful in all it teaches
  * Infallible (moral guidance and wisdom without fail) and 
  * Inerrant (error-free teachings)
* These are nuanced doctrines
  * Requires interpretation and understanding of the original text
* There are no inconsistencies, factual mistakes, and ethical errors that remain after deeper analysis
  * If any disagreement, then of minor importance, not faith shattering
