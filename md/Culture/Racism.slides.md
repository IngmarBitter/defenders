## Past Racism and Individual Responsibility

![](RacismAndJustice.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* The proper response to past injustice is contemporary justice
* Individual whites that did not personally commit racist offences are not morally accountable to individual blacks that did not personally experience racist disadvantaging.

## Past Racism and Collective Responsibility

## Woke Anti Racism

![](BlackOnWhiteRacism.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Only whites can be racist - why? By what definition of racism?
  * Maybe by: racism is discrimination of an inferior race by a superior race
  * But that would be a last century definition that is obsolete and itself racist
* Being white makes us automatically racist
  * Either we acknolege it and need to subjucate us to blacks
  * Or we deny being racist and are so deeply ingrained in racism that we dont even realize it.
  * So in both cases we are racist. It's unfalsifiable.

## Movie: Am I Racist?

![](AmIRacist.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

* Showed how DEI is a very lucrative bussiness for those running the re-education camps.
* Is not evidence based science.
* Impossible to find the politically correct line between racism and cultural appropriation
  * Don't oversmile 
    * <sub><sup>degrading, communicating I am better.</sub></sup>
  * Don't undersmile 
    * <sub><sup>ignoring, I want nothing to do with you.</sub></sup>
  * Buy the black hero costume for your child for halloween: forbidden cultural appropriation.
  * Don't buy it: forbidden white self centerdness.

## Affirmative Action

![](AffirmativeAction.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* AA: The acceptance or hiring of people by race in order to have the same race distribution as in the entire country
* Is unfair toward better qualified applicants from other races
* Eliminates meritocracy
* Eliminates confidence in the qualification of the selected person
* Eliminates respect for the abilities of that person because of his race
* Is inherently racist (affirms one race as lesser than the other)

## Martin Luther King

![](MLK.speech.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Hoped that one day we will 
  * not judge each other by the color of our skin
  * but by our character and work
* Achieving that requires not to point out racial differences unless they are really important in the situation
  * In most cases racial identity is not important
  * But we hear it a lot during political debates and rally speaches
    * That is what keeps race as a cause for national division

---

## Conclusions

![](RacePeace.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Racism used to be biological justified.
  * Understanding DNA fixed this.
* Systemic Racism's laws were eliminated.
* It is irrational to think that:
  * only whites can be racist, but not blacks.
  * being white makes one automatically racist.
  * whites today are responsible for the racism committed by whites and blacks in the past.
* The USA is one of the least racist countries in the world.
* The identity of the USA is not racism in its past,
  * but pioneering progess toward ever less racism through its history.
* Thank You!   -- Questions?
