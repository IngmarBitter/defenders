## Climate Change

![](ReferencesAll90.jpg style="float: right; height: 18rem")

* Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW)
  * Warming caused by humans
* From [Creation.com/climate-change](https://creation.com/climate-change)
  * By Don Batton
  * As of 2024.07.24
* A biblical and scientific analysis
  * From 90 scientific reference publications

## Dominion and Stewardship

![](DominionAndStewardship.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Gen 1:28 Dominion
  * *And God blessed them. And God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and **fill the earth** and subdue it, and **have dominion** over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”*

* Gen 2:15 Stewardship
  * *The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to cultivate and care for it.*

* Christians: responsibility for nature & people, incl. the world's poor

## Climate History

![](ClimateHistory.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Secular: Billions of years of flourishing nature + man's desecration of nature
   * => best to eliminate humans
* Bible: God's creation + fall + His upholding + man's filling the earth over 6000 years
   * => best to balance responsibilities

* Secular: Without humans (and without God) all changes were gradual
  * => no global flood, no ice age possible
* Bible: God caused global climate changes
  * => Noah's global flood, explains subsequent ice age

---

## CO2 History

![](GreenEarth.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Coal was formed from very dense vegetation
  * 15x more CO2 in the air then compared to today
  * No associated greenhouse heating effect
* 2°C above today during 1-400AD and 950-1300 without human CO2
  * Nature and humans flourished
* "Little ice age" 1300-1870 without CO2 change
  * shorter crop growing seasons => famines, plagues, poverty

---

## CO2 Elimination by Country

* USA, Canada and EU have decreasing CO2 emissions
* China produces more CO2 than USA, Canada and EU combined
  * China has refused to commit to CO2 reduction before 2030
  * China's main power source is coal
  * Climate activists should demonstrate at Chinese embassies

---

## CO2 Elimination by Technology

* Wood and dung are the worst power sources
* Coal is second worst, main source in China
* Wind and solar are costly to produce and intermittent
* Nuclear is the best by all measures
  * Why is nuclear not demanded by environmentalist?

## Failed Climate Model Predictions

![](EarthHotCold.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Since 1970 we are repeatedly given only a few more years to live
  * None of the hundrets of predictions were true
  * Bill Nye Science Guy
    * Venice flooding a hoax, water is not rising but city is sinking
* Climate models have uncertencies much larger than the predictions
* CO2 might correlate to temperature increase, but not cause it
* Peer review for grants has environmental bias
  * eliminates good science

---

## Actual Climate Data

![](TempAndCO2.jpg style="float: right; width: 15rem")

* CO2 285ppm 1860 and 410ppm 2020. Rising 0.002% per year
* Temperature 1.4°F rise since 1880, half of that before human CO2 rise.
* CO2 increases are NOT correlated to temperature increases
* Greenhouse effect is 90% water vapor, 10% CO2
* Biggest temperature effect is from sun's solar flares

## 97% Consensus Hoax

![](ManipulateStatistics.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Claim: 97% of scientists agree that human-generated CO2 will cause catastrophic warming
* USA: 31,500 scientist (9000 with PhD) opposed
* Based on meta paper finding that 97% of 12000 climate papers support "humans cause global warming"
* President Obama then tweeted "97% of scientists agree: climate change is real, man-made and dangerous."
* Authors were political activists. Classified only 64 of 12000 as supporting "humans cause is main cause"
* Other scientists found this warranted only for 41. => Less than 0.5%

---

## Science Subservient to Politics

![](PoliticsOverScience.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* 97% of scientists agree that human-generated CO2 will cause catastrophic warming
* Dr Peter Ridd fired from Marine Geophysical Laboratory at JCU after 15 years for climate alarmism criticism
* Temperature data "corrected" to show warming trends not in the original data
* Measurement methods changed that by design create higher temperatures
* Extreme weather tapering off publication withdrawn after political pressure

---

## Climate Activists are Hipocrites

![](Hypocrites.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Many rich activists
  * fly in private jets
  * live in mansions with huge carbon footprints
* Telling others to be mindful of the environment
  * Not living by example
* Michael Shellenberger energy advisor of Obama in 2020 apologized for 
  * scaring people incl. children
  * many false claims

## More CO2 is better

![](CO2Green.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Current predictions are that more CO2 will cause more clouds wich reflect more sunlight, which actually is the main cause of warming. Thus it is selfregulating and will not add more than 2°C.
* More CO2 and limited higher temperature will increase plant growth and food production.
* Allows vegetation in desert areas.
* Will benefit especially the poorer nations.
* No need for alarmism

---

## Poverty drives Pollution

![](WoodFireCooking.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Cooking with dung or wood is the worst
* Increase in per capita wealth reduces pollution
* Providing affordable energy to poor countries is most effective anti pollution strategy
* Coal (with filtering) and oil for electricity can make a difference quickly
* Nuclear would be ideal
* Making life more expensive in first world countries reduces optional purchases from poor countries
* Christianity + free market economy is best recipe for flourishing

---

## Conclusions

![](EarthInHands.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Politics has corrupted climate science
* CO2 has increased but is not the main cause for warming
* There are no good climate prediction models
* There is no trend of increased weather catastrophies
* There is no climate emergency
* Radical CO2 policies will hurt the poor the most
* Christianity + free market economy is best for flourishing and associated pollution reduction

* Thank You!   -- Questions?
