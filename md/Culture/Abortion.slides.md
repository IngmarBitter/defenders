* Luke 1:41 - When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the **baby** (brephos, βρέφος) leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
  * It's the same Greek word for young child, newborn and preborn, so baby is a good translation.
* Jeremiah 1:5 - "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart."
  * Personhood and identity are the same before and after birth.
* Psalm 139:13 - "For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb."

This amendment does not change the Legislature's constitutional authority to require notification to a parent or guardian before a minor has an abortion."
  * Will prevent making new laws and invalidate existing laws that restrict or make illegal before 24 weeks.

## Conclusions

![](RacePeace.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Racism used to be biological justified.
  * Understanding DNA fixed this.
* Systemic Racism's laws were eliminated.
* It is irrational to think that:
  * only whites can be racist, but not blacks.
  * being white makes one automatically racist.
  * whites today are responsible for the racism committed by whites and blacks in the past.
* The USA is one of the least racist countries in the world.
* The identity of the USA is not racism in its past,
  * but pioneering progess toward ever less racism through its history.
* Thank You!   -- Questions?
