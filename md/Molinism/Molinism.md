## Assurance of Salvation

C: **Once saved - always saved**. (always unconditional)

Needs to show that throwing away salvation is impossible <br>(impossibility of regenerate Christians disavowing belief, or becoming apostates or false teachers).

A,M: **Once belief saves - always belief saves**. (always conditional)

Needs to show that throwing away salvation is possible. <br>(real examples of regenerate Christians disavowing belief, or becoming apostates or false teachers).

## Romans 8:28-30

!!!
    28 We know that all things work together for good to *those who love God*, to those who are *called* according to His purpose. 29 For those whom He *foreknew*, He *predestined* to be conformed to the image of His Son, so that He might be the firstborn among many brothers. 30 And those whom He *predestined*, He also *called*; and those whom He *called*, He also *justified*; and those whom He *justified*, He also *glorified*.

* This is about those who truly love God, they are foreknown, predestined, called, justified and eventually glorified. 

* C: None of them is lost. Throwing away salvation is impossible.

* A,M: *Those who love God* is a group. That group has eternal security. If there are some that disavow, then they throw away the group membership and this passage no longer applies to them. Hence, this passage does not allow conclusions about throwing away salvation.

## John 6:39-40
!!!
    39 This is the will of the Father who has sent Me, that of all whom He has given Me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day. 40 This is the will of Him who sent Me, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him may have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.”

* C: The father gives Jesus elect individuals, and none of them is lost. They are all raised on the last day. Salvation is secure for the elect and cannot be thrown away.

* A,M: The *believes in Him* implies *perseveres to believe in Him*. Those have indeed assurance of salvatien. This passage does not talk about those that first believe and then disavow.  Hence, this passage does not allow conclusions about throwing away salvation.

## John 10:27-30
!!!
    27 My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me. 28 I give them eternal life. *They shall never perish, nor shall anyone snatch them from My hand*. 29 My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all. *No one is able to snatch them from My Father’s hand*. 30 My Father and I are one.”

* Jesus gives eternal life to those that know his voice and follow Him. He will not lose any one of them. And no one else can snatch them away. 

* Jesus gives eternal life to those that know his voice and follow Him. He will not lose any one of them. And no one else can snatch them away. 

* C: *Those that follow* are elect individuals. They cannot snatch themselves out of Jesus hand. Throwing away salvation is impossible.

* A,M: *Those that follow* is a group. That group has eternal security. If there are some that disavow, then they throw away the group membership and this passage no longer applies to them. Also snatching is never in referenc to self, so jumping out of Jesus hand is not discussed here. Hence, this passage does not allow conclusions about throwing away salvation.

## John 17:11
!!!
    11 I am to be no longer in the world, though these are in the world, for I am coming to You. Holy Father, through Your name *keep those whom You have given Me*, that they may be one as We are one.

* Jesus prays for us that the Father will keep/preserve Christians. Surely the Father will answer Jesus prayer.

* C: *Those whom you have given me* are elect individuals. Their salvation is secure - throwing it away would be against Jesus prayer to the Father.

* A,M: *Those whom you have given me* is the group of believers. That group has eternal security. If there are some that disavow, then they throw away the group membership and this passage no longer applies to them. Hence, salvation is secure for the group of believers, but it does not tell us if one can throw away his salvation.
* A,M: This may not even be about salvation, but about protection from physical harm due to persecution, that also would not allow conclusions about the impossibility to throw away salvation.

## 1 John 3:9
!!!
    9 Whoever has been born of God does not practice sin, for His seed remains in him. And he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God.
* C: Persistent sinning would be a reason to lose salvation. God's seed in the regenerate Christian prevents this and thus ensures salvation - throwing it away is impossible.

* A,M: God’s seed remains in Christias because God will not withdraw it. This verse does not tell us what happens if we throw out God’s seed. Hence this passage tells us about security of persevering Christians, but nothing about the impossibility of throwing away salvation.
