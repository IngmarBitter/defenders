# Eternal Security of the Elect

*** Assurance of Salvation ***

C: **Once saved - always saved**. (always unconditional)

Needs to show that throwing away salvation is impossible <br>(impossibility of regenerate Christians disavowing belief, or becoming apostates or false teachers).

A,M: **Once belief saves - always belief saves**. (always conditional)

Needs to show that throwing away salvation is possible. <br>(real examples of regenerate Christians disavowing belief, or becoming apostates or false teachers).

## Romans 8:28-30

!!!
    28 We know that all things work together for good to *those who love God*, to those who are *called* according to His purpose. 29 For those whom He *foreknew*, He *predestined* to be conformed to the image of His Son, so that He might be the firstborn among many brothers. 30 And those whom He *predestined*, He also *called*; and those whom He *called*, He also *justified*; and those whom He *justified*, He also *glorified*.

* This is about those who truly love God, they are foreknown, predestined, called, justified and eventually glorified. 

* C: None of them is lost. Throwing away salvation is impossible.

* A,M: *Those who love God* is a group. That group has eternal security. If there are some that disavow, then they throw away the group membership and this passage no longer applies to them. Hence, this passage does not allow conclusions about throwing away salvation.

---
## John 6:39-40
!!!
    39 This is the will of the Father who has sent Me, that of all whom He has given Me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day. 40 This is the will of Him who sent Me, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him may have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.”

* C: The father gives Jesus elect individuals, and none of them is lost. They are all raised on the last day. Salvation is secure for the elect and cannot be thrown away.

* A,M: The *believes in Him* implies *perseveres to believe in Him*. Those have indeed assurance of salvation. This passage does not talk about those that first believe and then disavow.  Hence, this passage does not allow conclusions about throwing away salvation.

---
## John 10:27-30
!!!
    27 My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me. 28 I give them eternal life. *They shall never perish, nor shall anyone snatch them from My hand*. 29 My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all. *No one is able to snatch them from My Father’s hand*. 30 My Father and I are one.”

* Jesus gives eternal life to those that know his voice and follow Him. He will not lose any one of them. And no one else can snatch them away. 

* Jesus gives eternal life to those that know his voice and follow Him. He will not lose any one of them. And no one else can snatch them away. 

* C: *Those that follow* are elect individuals. They cannot snatch themselves out of Jesus hand. Throwing away salvation is impossible.

* A,M: *Those that follow* is a group. That group has eternal security. If there are some that disavow, then they throw away the group membership and this passage no longer applies to them. Also snatching is never in referenc to self, so jumping out of Jesus hand is not discussed here. Hence, this passage does not allow conclusions about throwing away salvation.

---
## John 17:11
!!!
    11 I am to be no longer in the world, though these are in the world, for I am coming to You. Holy Father, through Your name *keep those whom You have given Me*, that they may be one as We are one.

* Jesus prays for us that the Father will keep/preserve Christians. Surely the Father will answer Jesus prayer.

* C: *Those whom you have given me* are elect individuals. Their salvation is secure - throwing it away would be against Jesus prayer to the Father.

* A,M: *Those whom you have given me* is the group of believers. That group has eternal security. If there are some that disavow, then they throw away the group membership and this passage no longer applies to them. Hence, salvation is secure for the group of believers, but it does not tell us if one can throw away his salvation.
* A,M: This may not even be about salvation, but about protection from physical harm due to persecution, that also would not allow conclusions about the impossibility to throw away salvation.

---

## 1 John 3:9
!!!
    9 Whoever has been born of God does not practice sin, for His seed remains in him. And he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God.
* C: Persistent sinning would be a reason to lose salvation. God's seed in the regenerate Christian prevents this and thus ensures salvation - throwing it away is impossible.

* A,M: God’s seed remains in Christias because God will not withdraw it. This verse does not tell us what happens if we throw out God’s seed. Hence this passage tells us about security of persevering Christians, but nothing about the impossibility of throwing away salvation.

---
## 1 John 5:18
!!!
    18 We know that whoever is born of God does not keep on sinning. But whoever has been born of God guards himself, and the wicked one cannot touch him.
* C: Regenerate Christians are incapable of persistent sinning. Hence throwing away our salvation is impossible.
* A,M: This gives us the reassurance that *guarding ourselves* is effective protection from the wicked one. It implies that we want to guard ourselves. This verse does not tell us what happens if we no longer want to guard ourselves but turn from God and blaspheme Him. So this passage does not tell us if throwing away our salvation is possible.

---
## Ephesians 1:13-14
!!!
    13 In Him [Christ] you also, after hearing the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and after believing in Him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, 14 who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of His glory.
* C: Regenerate Christians are sealed with the Holy Spirit. Our eternal life inheritance is guaranteed. So throwing away our salvation is impossible.
* A,M: Sealing is what we do to protect from outside influences, such as seams on the roof to keep the rain out. But even the best seal does not help if we leave the window open when it rains.  Also a guaranteed inheritance does not automatically mean than the inheritance will be received. The heir can renounce the inheritance and then will not get it. This verse does not tell us what happens if we turn from God and blaspheme Him. So this passage does not tell us if throwing away our salvation is possible.

---
## Romans 8:33-39
!!!
    33 Who shall bring a charge against *God’s elect*? It is God who justifies. 34 Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, yes, who is risen, who is also at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us. 35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? 36 As it is written:<br>
    “For Your sake we are killed all day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.”<br>
    37 No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us. 38 For I am persuaded that *neither death nor life, neither angels nor principalities nor powers, neither things present nor things to come, 39 neither height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us* from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
* C: *God's elect* refers to any individual regenerate Christian and God ensures their salvation against any immaginable opposition.  So throwing away our salvation is impossible.
* A,M: This is assurance of salvation for the group of *God’s elect*, for the group of believers. For that group salvation is secure.  However, this does not address if/how it is possible to leave that group. Notice that the beings that cannot take away salvation does not include members of the group itself. So this passage does not tell us if throwing away our salvation is possible.

---
## Ephesians 1:4-7
!!!
    4 just as He [God] chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, to be holy and blameless before Him in love;    5 He predestined us to adoption as sons to Himself through Jesus Christ according to the good pleasure of His will,    6 to the praise of the glory of His grace which He graciously bestowed on us in the Beloved.
* C: the elect were chosen to be holy/blameless. Throwing away salvation would imply not holy/blameless and thus contrary to God`s decree which is impossible. Hence it is impossible to throw away our salvation.
* A,M: He chose *us* refers to the group of believers. That group is will remain holy and not throw away salvation. This passage does not talk about individuals deciding to leave the group of believers and turn from God and blaspheme Him. So this passage does not tell us if throwing away our salvation is possible.


# The Individual’s Perseverance is Contingent 
## Colossians 1:21-23
!!!
    21 And you, who were formerly alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now He has reconciled    22 in the body of His flesh through death, to present *you holy and blameless* and above reproach in His sight,    23 *if you continue in the faith*, grounded and settled, and *are not removed from the hope of the gospel*, which you have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.
* A,M: remaining *holy and blameless* is clearly conditional on *not being removed*. That implies that first having salvation and then throwing it away is possible. 
* C: 1) *being removed* is a logical possibility, but not actual. From the other verses we know that God will make it impossible for the removal conditions to become actual.  Hence, in the actual world it is impossible to throw away salvation.
 * M: *impossible* means not in the actual world nor in any hypothetical world. That can only be true if we indeed do not have free will. But then this passage is irrelevant, and possibly all of the Bible is. God's different types of knowledge help much more here. On first level this passage tells us that salvation *could* be removed (logical possibility, God's free knowledge). *if you continue in the faith* is the condition that prevents the removing. It implies that peoplr *could* persevere and stay saved, or *could* not persevere and be removed. Through His middle knowledge God knows what *would* cause people to persevere. And apparently the warning in this passage is part of the means to do so. Consequently many Christians *will* persevere and not throw away salvation. So we don't know if this will work for all Christians or only some, but at least is is clear that throwing away salvation is possible. 
* C: 2) *if you continue in the faith* is a condition that limits the group of people Paul is talking to, namely only those that persevere. And those were made holy and blameless and will not be removed. Hence this passage is not talking about the possibility of first gaining and then throwing away salvation.
 * A,M: No, *if you continue in the faith* is a condition splitting the those made holy/blameless into two subsets: the perseverers and the apostates. Hence throwing away salvation is possible.

## Romans 11:17-32
!!!
    17 But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among them and became a partaker with them of the root and richness of the olive tree, 18 do not boast against the branches. If you boast, remember you do not sustain the root, but the root sustains you.  19 You will say then, “The branches were broken off, so that I might be grafted in.”  20 This is correct. They were *broken off because of unbelief*, but you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but fear.  21 For if God did not spare the natural branches, *neither will He spare you*.
    22 Therefore consider the goodness and severity of God —- severity toward those who fell, but goodness toward you, *if you continue in His goodness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off*.  23 And these also, if they do not remain in unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.  24 For if you were cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, who are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?
* A,M: The olive tree is the corporate body of believers that as a whole grants assurance of salvation. However, individual people are the branches of the tree that can be cut off because of unbelief. Thus throwing away ones salvation is possible.
* C 1): Someone grafted in is a real Christian, and as such would newer fall into unbelief, thus not be in danger of being cut off.
  * A,M: If that was true, then what is the pint of this passage, especially the *beause of unbelief [...] neither will He spare you.*?
    * C: This warning of possible being cut off is what God uses to ensure that all Christians *will* not fall into unbelief because they cannot act otherwise.
	  * M: A warning only makes sense if man is able to choose otherwise. So it's really: God gives the warning so that Christians who *could* fall into unbelief *would* not do so. It's unclear if this warning is 100% effective, but at least clear that throwing away salvation is possible.
* C 2): This is not speaking of the election of individuals, which remain steadfast forever, but of the election of the gentiles as a whole. – Calvin
  * A,M: That is illogical: the gentiles are a mix of elect and non-elect and *"you were grafted in"* cannot apply to both, but only the believers. And *“you will be cut off”* cannot refer to both, but only the non-believers. 

---
## Matthew 10:22
!!!
    22 You will be hated by all men for My name’s sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved.
* C: This verse encourages Christians, that enduring through hard times will be rewarded with eternal life. It tells us nothing about actual or potential non-enduring.
* A,M: The enduring will be saved implies the non-enduring will not be saved. And non-enduring implies transition from believing to not believing. Hence this verse teaches that throwing away salvation is possible, but that hardship is not a good reason to do so.
  * M: This encouragement to endure is what God knew would compel Christians to not fall into unbelief.

* No matter which view is right, this does show that Christians have no license to live like the devil, since doing so does not match with enduring to the end, same for all other warning verses.

---
## Hebrews 3:12-14
!!!
    12 Be attentive, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, and you depart from the living God. 13 But exhort one another daily, while it is called “Today,” lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. 14 For we have become partakers of Christ *if we hold* the beginning of our confidence *firmly to the end*,
* A,M: Christians are *partakers of Christ* conditional on persevering belief and that not persevering is possible through becoming *hardered*, a state of mind that makes one want to throw away salvation.
  * God knew this commad *would* help in Christians chosing *to hold firmly to the end*.
* C: This is a command to be followed, and regenerate Christians cannot do otherwise. 
  * A,M: If true, then the warning is unnecessary.

# Warnings against Apostasy
## Hebrews 6:4-8
!!!
   4 For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who shared in the Holy Spirit, 5 and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, 6 if they fall away, to be renewed once more to repentance, since they again crucify to themselves the Son of God and subject Him to public shame. 7 For land that drinks in the rain that often falls upon it and bears a crop useful to those for whom it is cultivated receives a blessing from God. 8 But land that bears thorns and thistles is rejected and near to being cursed. Its destiny is to be burned.
* A,M: To fall away from Christ is to re-crucify Him and to put Him to public shame. That cannot be fixed. It's stongly implied that this is possible, hence throwing away salvation is possible. (In addition, the analogy to the land bearing thorns being burned completely destroys the plant with no chance to get back to before. So throwing away our salvation is irreversible).
* C 1): This does not describe regenerate Christians, but merely people that were in the community of Christians but never personally repented and believed. 
  * A,M: How do you taste the heavenly gift and share in the Holy Spirit without being a Christian? Seems very farfetched.<br>and if it is true, then none of us can be sure that we are saved now!
* C 2): This does not describe really existing Christians, but merely hypothetical Christians. But through the consequences that would hypothetically happen, the real Christians are warned effectively such that they will never fall away. 
  * M: On Calvinism, warnings are not needed, since people already do only what Gad makes them to do,<br>on Molinism, this is a very good explanation, but does not guarantee that all Christians will heed the warning, i.e. God would give the most effective warning possible, but that could still be less than 100% effective. Thus the scenarios in the warnings could actually happen.

---
## Hebrews 10:26-31
!!!
   26 For if we willfully continue to sin after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, 27 but a fearful expectation of judgment and fiery indignation, which will devour the adversaries. 28 Anyone who despised Moses’ law died without mercy in the presence of two or three witnesses. 29 How much more severe a punishment do you suppose he deserves, who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and has regarded the blood of the covenant that sanctified him to be a common thing, and has insulted the Spirit of grace? 30 For we know Him who said, “Vengeance is Mine,” says the Lord, “I will repay.” And again He says, “The Lord will judge His people.” 31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
* A,M: Willful persistent sinning of regenerate Christians is not covered by Jesus’ sacrifice. It is trampling on Jesus and an insult to the Holy Spirit. That causes judgment and severe punishment. So throwing away our salvation is possible. This also teaches that one cannot become an apostate by accident or without knowing it. Apostasy is deliberate.
* C 1) This does not describe regenerate Christians, but merely people that heard about the Gospel but never personally repented and believed. Thus this does not teach that throwing away our salvation is possible.
  * A,M: Receiving knowledge of the truth according to Calvinist teaching is a spiritual act that is possible only after regeneration.
* C 2): This does not describe actually existing regenerate Christians, but merely is a hypothetical scenario. This warning is the means by which God ensures that the real regenerate Christians will never engage in willful persistent sinning. Thus this does not teach that throwing away our salvation is possible.
  * A,M: According to Calvinist teaching people do exactly what God planned for them to do. What makes warnings about hypothetical actions totally unnecessary? Why is it in the Bible?
  * M: On Molinism, this is a very good explanation, but does not guarantee that all Christians will heed the warning, i.e. God would give the most effective warning possible, but that could still be less than 100% effective. Thus the scenarios in the warnings could actually happen.

---
## Hebrews 6:32-36
!!!
   32 Remember the former days, after you were enlightened, in which you endured a great struggle of afflictions. 33 In part you were made a spectacle both by reproaches and afflictions. And in part you became companions of those who were so abused. 34 For you had compassion on me in my chains and joyfully endured the confiscation of your property, knowing that you have in heaven a better and an enduring possession for yourselves. 35 Therefore *do not throw away* your confidence, which will be greatly rewarded.
   36 For you need patience, so that after you have done the will of God, you will receive the promise.
* A,M: Christians (those enlightened) know that they have a reward in heaven, but they can throw it away. They will need patience to continue to believe to actually receive the reward.
* C 1): This is a command to be followed, and regenerate Christians cannot do otherwise. 
  * A,M: If true, then the warning is unnecessary.
* C 2) The possible throwing away the reward is only hypothetical. Really this warning against it is what will compel all Christians to not fall into unbelief.
  * A,M: According to Calvinist teaching people do exactly what God planned for them to do. What makes warnings about hypothetical actions totally unnecessary? Why is it in the Bible?
  * M: On Molinism, this is a very good explanation, but does not guarantee that all Christians will heed the warning, i.e. God would give the most effective warning possible, but that could still be less than 100% effective. Thus the scenarios in the warnings could actually happen.

---
## James 5:19-20
!!!
   19 Brothers, if any one of you strays from the truth and someone corrects him, 20 let him know that he who converts the sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins. 
* A,M: Christians (brothers) that are backsliding can be restored (through other Christians helping to repent and do better). But staying on the sinful path results in the death of the soul, that is throwing away salvation.
* C 1): This is a command to be followed, and regenerate Christians cannot do otherwise. 
  * A,M: If true, then the warning is unnecessary.
* C 2) The possible throwing away the reward is only hypothetical. Really this warning against it is what will compel all Christians to not fall into unbelief.
  * A,M: According to Calvinist teaching people do exactly what God planned for them to do. What makes warnings about hypothetical actions totally unnecessary? Why is it in the Bible?
  * M: On Molinism, this is a very good explanation, but does not guarantee that all Christians will heed the warning, i.e. God would give the most effective warning possible, but that could still be less than 100% effective. Thus the scenarios in the warnings could actually happen.

# Bible Apostates

## Judas Iscariot 
* Became a follower of Christ, loved Christ, believed Christ
* (Luke 22) turned and betrayed Jesus, thus no longer followed, loved & believed.

## 1 John 2:19
!!!
   19 They went out from us, but they were not of us, for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have remained with us. But they went out, revealing that none of them were of us.
* A,M 1): They were part of "us" and only distinguishable by their failure to persevere in faith. Hence they were initially saved Christians that then fell away as apostates.
  * C: no, *"if they had been of us"* means they were never Christians.
* A,M 2), C: There were people that appeared to be apostates, but never really were Christians. Thus this is not an example of apostates.

## Luke 8:4-8, 11-15
!!!
   4 When a large crowd had gathered together and people were coming to Him from every city, He told this parable: 5 “A sower went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some fell along the path and was trampled down, and the birds of the air devoured it. 6 Some fell on a rock. And as soon as it sprang up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture. 7 Yet some fell among thorns. And the thorns sprang up with it and choked it. 8 And other seed fell on good ground and sprang up and yielded a hundred times the amount sown.” [...]<br>
   11 “Now the parable means this: The seed is the word of God. 12 Those along the path are those who hear. Then comes the devil, who takes away the word from their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved. 13 Those on the rock are the ones who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy. But these have no root, for they ***believe for a while***, then in the time of temptation ***fall away***. 14 That which fell among thorns are those who, when they have heard, go out and are choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to maturity. 15 But the seed on the good ground are those who, having heard the word, keep it in an honest and good heart and bear fruit with patience.
* (1) Hears Gospel and does not believe [seeds along the path] – not saved
* (2) Hears Gospel, receives and believes (has faith in), falls away [seeds on the rock] – saved?
* (3) Hears Gospel, starts to grow, choked by earthly things, no fruits [seeds among thorns] – saved?
* (4) Hears Gospel, grows, bears lots of fruits [seeds on geed ground] – saved!
* A,M: (2) Jesus himself tells us they "believed". And then fell away. Thus first being saved and then deciding to throw away believe is possible for true Christians. This is an example of apostasy given by Jesus
  * C: The falling away shows that the prior faith was not saving faith. So those people were never saved.
    * A,M: So even if Jesus identifies believe, it’s not good enough? Are you serious?
* C: It’s a parable through which God teaches and ensures that real Cristians will never become part of (2). So this is not an example of actual apostates.
  * A,M: But all other paraples of Jesus have correspondence to real people.  There is no indication that this parable should be an exception. Hence this is an apostates example given by Jesus Himself.
* (3): Nominal Christian? Christmas & Easter only? Choked == no faith or little faith? Saved or not saved?
  * A,M,C: this is left as an exercise for the reader ;-) <br>To be on the safe side, let's not personally be in this category (3)

## 2 Peter 2:1,14-15,20-22
!!!
   1 But there were also false prophets among the people, just as *there will be false teachers among you*, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Lord who bought them, bringing swift destruction upon themselves.<br>
   14 They have eyes full of adultery that cannot cease from sin. They entice unstable souls. Their hearts are trained in greed. They are cursed children! 15 They have forsaken the right way and have gone astray.<br>
   20 For ***if*** *after they have escaped the defilements of the world* through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and they are *again entangled in them and are overcome*, the latter end is *worse for them than the beginning*. 21 For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than to have known it and then turn back from the holy commandment that was delivered to them. 
* A,M: The false teachers are Christians are the ones again overcome by defilements of the world. And are worse off than before, thus became apostates and threw away salvation.
* C: The actual false teachers in v1 are not the same people as the hypothetical apostates in v20. v20-21 are warnings that God uses to ensure that there will never be apostates.
  * A,M: no, v1-19 is a continuous thought about the same set of false prophets/teaches. Hence v20 is still about them and classifies them as apostates. this is a genuine example of apostates in the bible.
* Like the wife of a personal friend of mine: 80% of church saw her as the most godly person in the congregation. Her husband knew that she was not pretending, but a genuine Christian. Yet she fell away and followed false teaching and ungodly practices.

# Logical Contradiction
## 1 John 5:13
!!!
   13 I have written these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God.
1. Once Saved Always saved is true
2. -> There are no Apostates is true
3. There are apparent apostates
4. 2+3 -> apparent apostates were never saved
5. apparent apostated believed and had many gifts & fruits of the spirit
6. 4+5 -> belief and gifts & fruits of the spirit are not a reliable indicator of salvation
7. 1 John 5:13 -> belief is a reliable indicator of salvation
8. 6. and 7. are a logical contradiction
9. -> at least one of 1. to 7. is not true. Not 7 (bible verse), not 2,4,6,8 (logical conclusion), not 3,5 (biblical and contemporary examples), 1 is the only one left
10. -> 1 must be false

* A,M: good argument
* C: ???
