## Why


!!!
   Jesus said to him, “ ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ 
   1 Peter 3:15 HCSB  

![](hope.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

* Loving God with our mind includes digging deeper into not so obvious parts of scripture where believers have differed in the past on what the correct interpretation is
* We will honor difference of opinion
* We will make clear the reasons for and against each interpretation

---

## What

![](threeCircles.jpg style="float:right; width: 9rem")

1. Calvinism
   1. Emphasizes God's sovereignty, God's choosing us for salvation
2. Arminianism
   1. Emphasizes God giving us free will and holding us accountable for our choices
3. Molinism
   1. Emphasizies both, God's sovereingnty and our free will

---

## How

![](readingScroll.jpg style="float:right; width: 9rem")

* Clarify the distinctives in the views
* List the most relevant verses / passages for and against each view
* Provide interpretations of each form each view
* Provide critical commentary of each interpretation form the other view(s)

# Part I - Concepts

---
## Monergism - One Will

![](Dominos.jpg style="float:right; width: 9rem")

**Fatalism:** God decides Fate, no cause and effect. <br> 
E.g. Islam

**Determinism:** God decides every detail <br>
+ He uses cause and effect as means <br>
+ He plans the causes

**Compatibilism:** Determinism + man decides by his own desires <br>
-> man is responsible for choices <br>
+ God gives man his desires -> He ultimately makes all decisions <br>
E.g. Calvinism, Reformed

---
## Libertarian Free Will

![](CalvinFreeWill.jpg style="float:right; width: 11rem")

* **Man can really choose to do otherwise**
* God does not directly affect man's mind
* Cause and effect
* Man is responsible for choices
* God is just to convict of sin
* E.g. Arminianism, Molinism

---
## Sovereign

![](FreeWillVsDeterminism.jpg style="float:right; width: 11rem")

* **Posessing supreme ruling power**
* God cannot be overruled
* God can decide to create a world with
  * Fatalism
  * Determinism
  * Compatibilism
  * Libertarian Free Will
* E.g. Calvinism[^1], Arminianism, Molinism

[^1] insists that compatibilism is implied by God being sovereign

## Omnicience (All-Knowing)

| Natural Knowledge   | Middle Knowledge                   | Free Knowledge                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| could [^1]          | would [^2]                         | will [^3]                          |
| constraint by logic | ... and hypothecical circumstances | ... the world God actually created |

![](omnicience.jpg style="float:right; width: 6rem")

[^1] no married bachelors or square circles, not important to any of the three views
[^2] only Molinism contemplates this type of God's knowledge [^3]  past + present + future

>>> Natural Knowledge is what naturally could happen: all logically consistent possibilities.
>>>
>>> Free Knowlede is what will happen after God freely choose His decree for the world: just those things that will actually happen in our reality/world
>>>
>>> Middle Knowledge is what could happen if God choose to make a different world. This includes worlds with puppet people, with free will people and anything inbetween. Illogical options are not included and also not included is people choosing against their will/nature. It's like lego or minecraft worlds. There are limitations due to the building blocks, but nonetheless the result can be anything creatively desired.

---
## Foreknowledge

![](HandsEarth.jpg style="float:right; width: 9rem")

* **God knows the future** 
* Including man's decisions
* Foreknowing an event/decision is ***not*** causing it

>>> I know in five minutes the weather will be similar to now, but knowing that future event does not make me the cause of it

---
## Providence

![](ManyWorlds.jpg style="float:right; width: 9rem")

* **God's plan (decree) for the world**
* Decided by God before He created the world
* By His free will only and for His Glory
* God decided if foreknown human decisions affect the plan
  * Calvinism: they don't
  * Free Will: they do

---

## Order of Creation

| Calvinism                           | Ariminianism                | Molinism                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| plan -> foreknowledge               | foreknowledge -> plan [^1]  | middle knowledge -> best human choices plan |
| -> everything according to His will | -> nothing against His will | -> nothing against His will                 |

![](DivineChess.jpg style="float:right; width: 5rem")

[^1] How to ensure the cross for Jesus?

>>> Calvinism is straight forward: God freely decides what He wants and decrees the world to be that way - including who will go to heaven and who will go to hell. Success is ensured because he is in full controll of everything that happens and man cannot act differently than He planned.
>>>
>>> Arminianism has God make a plan that foremost gives people free will. Because of that who will go to heaven is a corporate decision: God decided that those who will believe will go. Man will use his free will to believe or not.
>>> However, God's plan includes everything accross all time, our decisions, His answering prayer. So given that He knows what we will choose He matches that with a plan or His own actions that that He will get what He wants. It seems the logical order of planning events of history had to be step by step: His action, foreknow our action, plan His next action, foreknow again and so forth. But how does that ensure the cross for Jesus? It seems unlikely that something such unfair would be the result.
>>>
>>> Molinism is a combination of the other two where as in Arminianism God decided to give us free will and thus in principle made going to heaven a corporate decision to include all those that will believe. However, God did not contemplate only the one world that He eventually create, but infinately many other possible worlds as well. For each one He knew how we would decide if He was to make that particular world with its particular circumstances. If He did not like one of our choices, He looked for a different possible world in which circumstances are different such that we are not presented with that choice or such that our past experiences in that world contribute to us making a different choice. He could simultaneously think through all possible what-if scenarios and then choose to actually create the one that He liked best. That was be our world in which Jesus did indeed die on the cross for us and in which He specifically shaped circumstances for each person to help him to find and trust Jesus - or at least for all those that under some circumstance would believe. That means God is orchestrating the election of each individual inspite of the criteria being corporate.

## TULIP & ROSES

## Election (Unconditional vs Sovereign)

God elected those to eternal life ...

| Calvinism                      | Ariminianism                          | Molinism                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| ... that He chose individually | ... that will believe corporately[^2] | ... that will believe corporate+individual[^3] |
| God chooses belief[^1]         | man chooses belief                    | man choses belief                              |

![](PickOne.png style="float:right; width: 2rem")
[^1] man cannot act otherwise.  [^2] God cannot elect individuals.
[^3] God chooses the best combination of circumstances in which He helps individuals to believe
---

## Original Sin

We inherit from Adam ...

| Calvinism       | Ariminianism   | Molinism       |
| --------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Mortality [^1]  | Mortality[^1]  | Mortality[^1]  |
| Sin nature [^2] | Sin nature[^2] | Sin nature[^2] |
| Sin guilt [^3]  |                |                |

[^1] We will surely die (grow old and die).
[^2] Temptations are real.
[^3] The being accountable for moral wrong doing. If inherited => infants need Jesus!?

>>> How can infants claim Jesus's sacrifice for them if they were too young to understand right and wrong, to believe and trust in Jesus?

---

## Calling

| Calvinism                             | Ariminianism                        | Molinism                            |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| General Call + irresistible grace[^1] | General Call + pervenient grace[^2] | General Call + pervenient grace[^2] |

[^1] Command to all. Elect: made to accept. Others: Sin-guilt for rejecting.
[^2] Call to all. Pervenient grace for all, makes accepting possible.

>>> 1 Seems unfair that the non-elect are prevented from accepting but are held accountable for not accepting

>>> 2 Like a prodical son soon after leaving. He was lost to the dad, the relationship broken and no desire by the son to restore the relationship. Pervenient grace makes reconsiliation an option to be considered.

---

## Gospel Response

![](OriginalSin.jpg style="float:right; width: 7rem")
-> Gospel comprehension<br>
. -> Conviction of personal sin-guilt<br>
. . -> Repentance<br>
. . . -> Faith & Trust in Christ (gospel heart knowledge)
| Calvinism           | Ariminianism          | Molinism              |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| God gives Faith[^1] | Man chooses faith[^2] | Man chooses faith[^2] |
[^1] faith only possible when spiritually alive => Regeneration must come first.
[^2] man is spiritually alive before faith, but with a broken relationship

>>> choosing faith is what communicates to God that we are accepting His offer to re-establish the relationship

---

## Regeneration + Justification

Regeneration: God gives us a new heart / life. <br>
Justification: God flipps our moral legal status from guilty to righteous.
Both are simultaneous, part of the same package deal.

| Calvinism                         | Ariminianism | Molinism |
| --------------------------------- | ------------ | -------- |
| God regenerates and justifies[^1] | same[^2]     | same[^2] |

![](Regeneration.jpg style="float:right; height: 5rem")
![](Faith.jpg style="float:right; height: 5rem")
[^1] regeneration -> faith <br>
[^2] faith -> regeneration 

---

## Sanctification

![](Sanctification.jpg style="float:right; width: 13rem")
All three:
Sanctification: As we mature as Christians we get to know Jesus better and become better in following His guidance for our life.

---

## Preservation vs Perseverence

| Calvinism               | Ariminianism        | Molinism                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| God preserves the elect | The elect persevere | The elect persevere as God supports individuals |
| individual[^1]          | corporate[^2]       | corporate + individual[^3]                      |

[^1] God ensures each elect believer will have eternal life. <br>
[^2] God ensures the group of believing people will have eternal life. But individuals can disavow the group and throw away eternal life.<br>
[^3] as 2 and God uses Bible warnings + circumstances to help individuals

---
## Eternal Security

**Once saved - always saved**<br>
* An individual regenerated Christian cannot fall away from the faith and **cannot lose salvation**, because God is 100% responsible for saving people and for preserving their salvation. (Calvinism)

**Once belief saved - always belief saves**<br>
* The class of believers cannot lose salvation.<br> 
* An individual regenerated Christian **can throw away salvation**: disavow the group of eternally secure believers by blaspheming God and becoming an apostate. (Arminianism and Molinism)<br>
* God minimizes the apostates via the most effective Bible warnings + circumstances (Molinism)


---

# Part II - Scripture <br> Eternal Security

---

## Assurance of Salvation

C: **Once saved - always saved**. (always unconditional)

Needs to show that throwing away salvation is impossible <br>(impossibility of regenerate Christians disavowing belief, or becoming apostates or false teachers).

A,M: **Once belief saves - always belief saves**. (always conditional)

Needs to show that throwing away salvation is possible. <br>(real examples of regenerate Christians disavowing belief, or becoming apostates or false teachers).
