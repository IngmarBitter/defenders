# Overview: The Holy Spirit in Christian Doctrine

---

## Where We Are In Defenders

* We’ve been studying the Doctrine of God (existence and nature of God)
  * Attributes of God
  * Natural theology and objections
  * Doctrine of the Trinity
* Next: **pneumatology** — the doctrine of the Holy Spirit
* The Holy Spirit is often called “the forgotten person of the Trinity”

---

## Pneumatology

* From Greek *pneuma* (“spirit”, “wind”)
* Not primarily about “power” or “experiences”
  * Personhood: Who is the Spirit?
  * Deity: Is the Spirit God?
  * Work: What does the Spirit do?
* Goal: see the Spirit’s role across Scripture and Christian life

---

## “Forgotten Person” (Why?)

* Early church controversies focused on Christology and Trinity
  * Limited early reflection on the Spirit
* Even creeds can sound brief about the Spirit
  * e.g., “and in the Holy Spirit”
* Modern neglect can show up in theology and practice
  * “God, man, and Christ” as a curriculum title is telling
* Goal: recover both the **person** and **work** of the Spirit

---

# Personhood of the Holy Spirit

---

## Third Person of the Trinity

* The Holy Spirit is the **third person** of the Trinity
  * Co-equal with the Father and the Son
  * Fully divine, fully personal
* Not “Jesus’ ghost” (archaic “Holy Ghost” can mislead)
* Therefore: don’t speak of the Spirit as an “it”

---

## Personhood: The Spirit Speaks

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    “[…] the Holy Spirit said, ‘Now separate to Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.’”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Acts 13:2</em></p>

* Speech + first-person pronouns (“me”) indicate personhood
* The Spirit issues directives and calls people to mission

---

## Personhood: The Spirit Teaches and Guides

* Jesus promises “another Counselor/Helper”
  * The Spirit will be “with you” and “in you” (John 14:15–17)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “If you love Me, keep My commandments. And I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may abide with you forever, the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him; but you know Him, for He dwells with you and will be in you.”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>John 14:15–17 (NKJV)</em></p>

  * The Spirit will “teach you all things” (John 14:25–26)
  * The Spirit will “guide you into all truth” (John 16:13–15)
* Note: NT writers sometimes use masculine reference for the Spirit
  * Emphasizes “who”, not “which"

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things […]”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>John 14:25–26 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth […]”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>John 16:13 (NKJV)</em></p>

---

## Personhood: The Spirit Intercedes

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us […] according to the will of God.”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Romans 8:26–27 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Intercession implies mind, intention, and agency
* “The mind of the Spirit” (Romans 8:27) → personal subject

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “Now He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God.”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Romans 8:27 (NKJV)</em></p>

---

## Distinctness: Not the Father or the Son

* The Spirit is not merely the Father/Son “in a different role”
* Triadic formulas name three distinct persons together
  * Baptismal formula (Matthew 28:19)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Matthew 28:19 (NKJV)</em></p>

  * Benediction (2 Corinthians 13:14)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>2 Corinthians 13:14 (NKJV)</em></p>

---

# Deity of the Holy Spirit

---

## The Spirit Is God

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit […]? […] You have not lied to men but to God.”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Acts 5:3–4 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Peter equates lying to the Spirit with lying to God
* Conclusion: the Spirit is not a created messenger; the Spirit is divine

---

## Attributes of Deity (Overview)

* Divine attributes explicitly predicated of the Spirit
  * Eternity (Hebrews 9:14)
  * Omnipresence (Psalm 139:7–8)
  * Omniscience (1 Corinthians 2:10–11)
  * Holiness (Romans 1:4)
  * Love (Romans 5:5)

---

## Eternity

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God […]”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Hebrews 9:14 (NKJV)</em></p>

* “Eternal” is a divine attribute
* The Spirit is not a late addition to God’s life

---

## Omnipresence

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence?”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Psalm 139:7 (NKJV)</em></p>

* The Spirit is not localized like a creature
* The Spirit is present with God’s people everywhere

---

## Omniscience

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God. […] Even so no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>1 Corinthians 2:10–11 (NKJV)</em></p>

* The Spirit comprehends the thoughts of God
* This is not creaturely knowledge

---

## Holiness and Love

* The Spirit is “the Spirit of holiness” (Romans 1:4)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “and declared to be the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead.”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Romans 1:4 (NKJV)</em></p>

* God’s love is poured into our hearts “through the Holy Spirit” (Romans 5:5)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us.”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Romans 5:5 (NKJV)</em></p>

* These attributes underline the Spirit’s full deity and personal agency

---

# Relation of the Holy Spirit to Christ

---

## Conception of Christ

* Virginal conception is attributed to the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:35)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you; therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God.”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Luke 1:35 (NKJV)</em></p>

* From the beginning of the incarnation, the Spirit is active

---

## Baptism and Anointing

* At Jesus’ baptism, Father/Son/Spirit are all present (Luke 3:21–22)
  * Spirit descends upon the Son
  * Public inauguration and empowering for ministry

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “When all the people were baptized, it came to pass that Jesus also was baptized; and while He prayed, the heaven was opened. And the Holy Spirit descended in bodily form like a dove upon Him […]”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Luke 3:21–22 (NKJV)</em></p>

---

## Miracles and Exorcisms

* Jesus’ mighty works are performed “through” the Spirit’s power
  * Peter summarizes: God anointed Jesus with the Holy Spirit and power (Acts 10:38)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him.”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Acts 10:38 (NKJV)</em></p>

  * Jesus attributes exorcisms to the Spirit of God (Matthew 12:28)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, surely the kingdom of God has come upon you.”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Matthew 12:28 (NKJV)</em></p>

---

## Preaching and Mission

* Jesus ministers “in the power of the Spirit” (Luke 4:14)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “Then Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and news of Him went out through all the surrounding region.”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Luke 4:14 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Isaiah’s prophecy applied to Jesus’ preaching: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me…” (Luke 4:18–21)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “The Spirit of the Lord is on Me, Because He has anointed Me To preach the gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, To proclaim liberty to the captives And recovery of sight to the blind, To set at liberty those who are oppressed; To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Luke 4:18–21 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Implication: if Jesus’ earthly ministry is Spirit-empowered, ours must be also

---

## Continuing Christ’s Ministry

* Jesus: it is “to your advantage” that he goes away so the Spirit comes (John 16:7)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “Nevertheless I tell you the truth. It is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send Him to you.”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>John 16:7 (NKJV)</em></p>

* The Spirit continues and extends Christ’s ministry in the church age
  * Convicts the world
  * Guides into truth
  * Glorifies Christ (John 16:13–15)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come. He will glorify Me, for He will take of what is Mine and declare it to you.”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>John 16:13–15 (NKJV)</em></p>

# Work of the Holy Spirit

---

## A “Startling” List of Ministries

* The Spirit is everywhere in Christian doctrine and life
* The Spirit’s work is not a narrow “add-on” to salvation
  * Creation and providence
  * Revelation and Scripture
  * Salvation’s application (new birth, indwelling, assurance)
  * Sanctification and fruit
  * Empowering and gifting the church

---

## (1–3) Scripture and Revelation

* OT: God’s “Spirit” is active (e.g., Gen 1:2), though the personhood is less differentiated
* The Spirit reveals God’s truth (1 Corinthians 2:9–13)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “But as it is written: ‘Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, Nor have entered into the heart of man The things which God has prepared for those who love Him.’ But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God. […] These things we also speak, not in words which man’s wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>1 Corinthians 2:9–13 (NKJV)</em></p>

* The Spirit inspires Scripture (2 Pet 1:20–21)
  * “Men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God"

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation, for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit.”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>2 Peter 1:20–21 (NKJV)</em></p>

---

## (4–7) Salvation Applied

* Conception of Christ (Luke 1:35)
* Regeneration / new birth (John 3:5–7)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “Jesus answered, ‘Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.’”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>John 3:5–7 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Indwelling and Spirit-baptism as belonging to Christ (Romans 8:9; 1 Cor 12:13)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His.” (Romans 8:9)
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Romans 8:9 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free—and have all been made to drink into one Spirit.” (1 Corinthians 12:13)
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>1 Corinthians 12:13 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Assurance of salvation (Romans 8:14–16)
  * The Spirit bears witness with our spirit

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. […] The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Romans 8:14–16 (NKJV)</em></p>

---

## (8–10) Life, Gifts, and Fruit

* Enablement for holy living (Galatians 5:16–18, 25)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. […] But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.” (Galatians 5:16–18)
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Galatians 5:16–18 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.” (Galatians 5:25)
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Galatians 5:25 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Distribution of spiritual gifts (1 Corinthians 12:4–11)
  * Given “as he wills” for the common good

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. […] But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually as He wills.”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>1 Corinthians 12:4–11 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Production of spiritual fruit (Galatians 5:22–24)
  * The most reliable evidence of Spirit-filled life

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law.”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Galatians 5:22–24 (NKJV)</em></p>

---

# OT: Temporary Empowerment

---

## Pattern Before Pentecost

* In the Old Covenant, God’s Spirit often “comes upon” individuals
  * For a **specific task**
  * For a **limited time**
* Pentecost is a “hinge” in the Spirit’s ministry

---

## Example: Skilled Craftsmanship

* Bezalel (and others) filled with God’s Spirit for craftsmanship
  * Tabernacle design, artistry, teaching skill (Exodus 31:1–3; Exodus 35:30–35)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: ‘See, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,’”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Exodus 31:1–3 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Takeaway: Spirit empowerment is not only “religious ecstasy”
  * It includes practical gifting for God’s purposes

---

## Example: Leadership and Prophetic Empowering

* Seventy elders share in the Spirit’s empowering for governance (Numbers 11:16–17, 25)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “So the Lord said to Moses: ‘Gather to Me seventy men of the elders of Israel […] Then I will come down and talk with you there. I will take of the Spirit that is upon you and will put the same upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you may not bear it yourself alone.’” (Numbers 11:16–17)
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Numbers 11:16–17 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “Then the Lord came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and placed the same upon the seventy elders; and it happened, when the Spirit rested upon them, that they prophesied, although they never did so again.” (Numbers 11:25)
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Numbers 11:25 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Judges are raised up with Spirit-empowerment for deliverance
  * Othniel (Judg 3:9–10)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “When the children of Israel cried out to the Lord, the Lord raised up a deliverer for the children of Israel, who delivered them: Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother. The Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he judged Israel.”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Judges 3:9–10 (NKJV)</em></p>

  * Gideon (Judg 6:34)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “But the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon; then he blew the trumpet, and the Abiezrites gathered behind him.”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Judges 6:34 (NKJV)</em></p>

  * Jephthah (Judg 11:29)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh, and passed through Mizpah of Gilead; and from Mizpah of Gilead he advanced toward the people of Ammon.”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Judges 11:29 (NKJV)</em></p>

  * Samson (Judg 13–15)

---

# NT: Permanent Indwelling

---

## Temple Shift: From Place to People

* Old Covenant: special locus of God’s presence in tabernacle/temple (Holy of Holies)
  * Glory fills the temple (2 Chr 7:1–3)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “When Solomon had finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the Lord filled the temple. And the priests could not enter the house of the Lord, because the glory of the Lord had filled the Lord’s house.”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>2 Chronicles 7:1–3 (NKJV)</em></p>

  * Ezekiel depicts the glory departing in judgment (Ezek 9:3; 11:23)
* New Covenant: the believer becomes the Spirit’s temple
  * “Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit” (1 Corinthians 6:19–20)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>1 Corinthians 6:19–20 (NKJV)</em></p>

---

## Acts 1:8 “Timeline”

* Jesus promises power when the Spirit comes (Acts 1:8)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
        “But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.”
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Acts 1:8 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Acts shows an outward expansion of Spirit bestowal
  * Jerusalem/Judea (Acts 2)
  * Samaria (Acts 8)
  * Gentiles (Acts 10–11)
  * Further confirmation (Acts 19)
* The Spirit is given to form one unified church body

---

## Baptism of the Spirit Creates “One Body”

* The baptism of the Holy Spirit is the transition point
  * The Spirit indwells and incorporates believers into Christ
* Key summary text: 1 Cor 12:13

---

# Baptism of/by the Holy Spirit

---

## What It Is (And Is Not)

* Rejects: “baptism in the Spirit” as a later second work of grace
  * Not an elite, post-conversion upgrade
* Affirms: Spirit baptism as an initiatory work
  * The Spirit places believers into Christ’s body

---

## Key Text: 1 Corinthians 12:13

* “By one Spirit we were all baptized into one body…”
* Inference:
  * Spirit baptism is universal among believers (“we were all")
  * It is the church-forming, Christ-uniting act of the Spirit

---

## Acts Case Studies (Initial Reception)

* Acts 2: Pentecost — initial bestowal on the church in Jerusalem
* Acts 8: Samaritans — receive the Spirit through apostolic recognition
* Acts 10–11: Gentiles (Cornelius’ household) — Spirit falls as at the beginning
* Acts 19: Ephesian disciples — had not even heard of the Spirit; then receive
* In each narrative, it is **initial reception**, not “second blessing”

---

## Water Baptism vs Spirit Baptism

* In Acts, the relation between water baptism and Spirit baptism varies
  * Sometimes before, sometimes after, sometimes independent
* This is historical transition complexity
  * Not a template for a universal “two-stage” Christian life

---

## Diagnostic Text: Romans 8:9

* “Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him”
* Implication:
  * If you belong to Christ, you have the Spirit
  * Spirit indwelling (and the Spirit’s initiating work) marks true Christians

---

# Fullness of the Holy Spirit

---

## Indwelling vs Filling

* Distinguishes:
  * **Indwelling**: the Spirit’s presence in every believer
  * **Filling**: being empowered/controlled by the Spirit
* Illustration:
  * “Filled with jealousy” or “filled with rage” ⇒ controlled by it
  * “Filled with the Spirit” ⇒ Spirit-directed life

---

## Natural, Carnal, Spiritual

* Uses Paul’s categories (1 Corinthians 2:14–3:3)
  * Natural (unregenerate): does not have the Spirit
  * Carnal (regenerate but flesh-dominated): immature and ineffective
  * Spiritual (regenerate and Spirit-empowered): discernment and fruit
* Works can be tested: gold vs wood/hay/straw (1 Corinthians 3:11–15)

---

## Gifts Are Not the Proof

* Corinth had many charismatic gifts, yet was deeply carnal
  * Therefore gifts ≠ reliable sign of fullness
* Emphasizes: the key evidence is **fruit**
  * Gal 5:22–24 (love, joy, peace, etc.)

---

## Why Many Christians Aren’t Filled

* Two main causes
    1. Lack of total commitment
      * “Cares of the world… delight in riches… desire for other things” (Mark 4)
      * Contrast: “Seek first the kingdom…” (Matthew 6:33)
      * Prescription: present yourself as a living sacrifice (Romans 12:1–2)
    2. Reliance on self-effort
      * The Christian life cannot be lived by the flesh
      * “Apart from me you can do nothing” (John 15:4–5)

* Pursue fullness:
  * Whole-life surrender to God’s will (Romans 12:1–2)
  * Ongoing dependence / abiding (John 15:4–5)
  * Aim at fruit, not spiritual status-signals (Galatians 5:22–25)
