## The Spirit Is a Person

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"[…] the Holy Spirit said, 'Now separate to Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.'"</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Acts 13:2 (NKJV)</em></p>

* He speaks, teaches, guides, intercedes (Acts 13:2; John 14:26; 16:13; Romans 8:26–27)
* He has a mind and will (Romans 8:27)
* He can be grieved and quenched (Ephesians 4:30; 1 Thessalonians 5:19)
* **Not** an impersonal "active force"

## The Spirit Is God

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit […]? […] You have not lied to men but to God."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Acts 5:3–4 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Lying to the Holy Spirit = lying to God → the Spirit is God
* Possesses divine attributes: eternal, omnipresent, omniscient, holy
* Distinct from Father and Son, yet fully divine
* Third person of the Trinity — co-equal, not subordinate

## The Spirit and Christ

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Luke 4:18 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Active in Christ's conception, baptism, miracles, and preaching
* Jesus ministered "in the power of the Spirit"
* The Spirit continues and extends Christ's ministry in the church
* Implication: if Jesus needed the Spirit, so do we

## The Spirit's Work in Believers

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Romans 8:9 (NKJV)</em></p>

* **Indwelling:** Every believer has the Spirit (Romans 8:9)
* **Baptism:** At conversion, not a "second blessing" (1 Corinthians 12:13)
* **Fullness:** Commanded, continuous, evidenced by fruit (Ephesians 5:18)
* **Walking:** Daily dependence, not one-time event (Galatians 5:16)

## Refuting the JW View

* JWs claim the Spirit is an impersonal "active force"
* **Problem:** Scripture attributes personal actions to the Spirit
  * Speaking, teaching, guiding, interceding, grieving
* **Problem:** Scripture calls the Spirit "God" (Acts 5:3–4)
* **Problem:** Scripture uses masculine pronouns for the Spirit (John 14–16)
* **Problem:** Triadic formulas treat Spirit as co-equal person (Matthew 28:19)
* Every JW argument fails under scrutiny of the text

## Practical Takeaways

* **Be assured:** If you belong to Christ, you have the Spirit (Romans 8:9)
* **Pursue fullness:**
  * Whole-life surrender to God's will (Romans 12:1–2)
  * Ongoing dependence / abiding in Christ (John 15:4–5)
  * Aim at fruit, not spiritual status-signals (Galatians 5:22–25)
* **Don't grieve or quench:** Confess sin, yield to His promptings
* **Hope:** Fresh filling is always available to those who return

---

## The Spirit Is Not Forgotten

* The Holy Spirit is fully God, fully personal, fully active
* He was there at creation, at Christ's conception, at Pentecost
* He indwells, baptizes, fills, empowers, and produces fruit in believers
* He is not a force to be harnessed but a Person to be yielded to
* **Recovering the Spirit** means recovering the power of the Christian life
