# Baptism of/by the Holy Spirit

---

## What It Is (And Is Not)

* Rejects: “baptism in the Spirit” as a later second work of grace
  * Not an elite, post-conversion upgrade
* Affirms: Spirit baptism as an initiatory work
  * The Spirit places believers into Christ’s body

---

## Key Text: 1 Corinthians 12:13

* “By one Spirit we were all baptized into one body…”
* Inference:
  * Spirit baptism is universal among believers (“we were all")
  * It is the church-forming, Christ-uniting act of the Spirit

---

## Acts Case Studies (Initial Reception)

* Acts 2: Pentecost — initial bestowal on the church in Jerusalem
* Acts 8: Samaritans — receive the Spirit through apostolic recognition
* Acts 10–11: Gentiles (Cornelius’ household) — Spirit falls as at the beginning
* Acts 19: Ephesian disciples — had not even heard of the Spirit; then receive
* In each narrative, it is **initial reception**, not “second blessing”

---

## Water Baptism vs Spirit Baptism

* In Acts, the relation between water baptism and Spirit baptism varies
  * Sometimes before, sometimes after, sometimes independent
* This is historical transition complexity
  * Not a template for a universal “two-stage” Christian life

---

## Diagnostic Text: Romans 8:9

* “Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him”
* Implication:
  * If you belong to Christ, you have the Spirit
  * Spirit indwelling (and the Spirit’s initiating work) marks true Christians
