I.  Introduction

Today we begin a new section in Defenders class. Before we do so, let’s step back and reconnoiter so that we see the big picture.

For the last year or so we’ve been studying the Doctrine of God – the existence and nature of God. The first subject that we looked at under this general heading was the attributes of God. We looked at such properties as omniscience, omnipotence, aseity, eternity, holiness, love, and so on. Then we did an excursus on natural theology looking at arguments for God’s existence such as the cosmological argument, the moral argument, the teleological argument, and then we looked at arguments against God’s existence as well. Finally, most recently, we just finished a subsection on the Doctrine of the Trinity.

Today we want to start with a new subsection of the Doctrine of God – the Holy Spirit. Theologians often refer to this area as pneumatology. That comes from the Greek word pneuma which means “spirit” or “wind.” Obviously this is the word from which we get our word “pneumatic” as in a pneumatic drill or pneumatic hammer. We are going to be studying pneumatology or the Doctrine of the Holy Spirit.

The Holy Spirit has rightly been called the forgotten person of the Trinity. When you look at the early post-apostolic fathers it seems that they were virtually binitarians rather than trinitarians. They believed in God the Father and his Word or Logos who proceeded from the Father. But there was almost nothing said about the person of the Holy Spirit. The trinitarian and Christological controversies that dominated the early church for centuries precluded any in-depth discussion of the person of the Holy Spirit. So, for example, in the Apostles’ Creed, all you find with regard to the Holy Spirit is the statement, “I believe in the Holy Spirit” which begs the question – what do you believe about the Holy Spirit? In the Nicene Creed the confession is even briefer. After saying I believe in the Father and the Son and those persons are explained, it says, “and in the Holy Spirit.” He is sort of thrown in there at the end for good measure.

Even today I find that the Holy Spirit seems to be neglected by many Christians. For example, in my own seminary education one of the courses that we took as part of our core curriculum in the Master of Divinity program was a systematic theology course entitled, “God, Man, and Christ.” When you think about it, that is very odd. Is that a new sort of unholy Trinity composed of God, man, and Christ? What happened to the Holy Spirit? He was rather left out, I’m afraid.

So we want to spend some time talking about the person and work of the Holy Spirit.

II.  Person of the Holy Spirit

         A.  Third Person of the Trinity

Who is the Holy Spirit? The Holy Spirit is the third person of the Trinity. As such, he is co-equal with God the Father and with God the Son. The Holy Spirit is God. We’ve already looked at some of the verses on the deity of the Spirit, but let’s look at Acts 5:3-4 once again. There Peter says to Ananias, who has attempted to keep some of the proceeds of the land that he sold,

“Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back part of the proceeds of the land? While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? How is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God.”

So in verse 3 he says, “Satan has filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit” and then in verse 5 he says, “You have lied to God himself.” So the Holy Spirit is God.

The Holy Spirit is not the ghost of Jesus, as might be suggested by the unfortunate archaic translation “the Holy Ghost.” The Holy Spirit is not Jesus’ ghost who somehow still is roaming the Earth after Jesus has departed to heaven. Rather the Holy Spirit is the third person of the Trinity. As such, the Holy Spirit is a person – a self-conscious, rational individual. The Holy Spirit is not an “it”; we should never refer to the Holy Spirit as “it” because he is not an impersonal force. The Holy Spirit is a “who” not a “which.”

Look, for example, at Acts 13:2, “While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, ‘Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.’” Here the Holy Spirit speaks and uses first person pronouns in reference to himself, “me” and “I,” which only a person can do. Look also in the Gospel of John –  John 14:15-17. Here Jesus says,

If you love me, you will keep my commandments. And I will pray the Father, and he will give you another Counselor, to be with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him; you know him, for he dwells with you, and will be in you.

Here Jesus promises the advent of the Counselor – the Holy Spirit – who will come in his place and will indwell believers. As I explained when we looked at the doctrine of the Trinity, John actually violates Greek grammar in this verse in using a masculine pronoun for the Holy Spirit. The word “spirit” in the Greek is neuter, and yet John uses a masculine pronoun “he” with respect to the Holy Spirit.

Reading further in John 14:25-26,

These things I have spoken to you, while I am still with you. But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.

Here we have the teaching ministry of the Holy Spirit, which obviously again shows that he is a person, since he is going to be teaching Jesus’ followers the teaching that Jesus has given them.

Then in John 16:7-15 Jesus expands on this. He says,

Nevertheless I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Counselor will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. And when he comes, he will convince the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment: concerning sin, because they do not believe in me; concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will see me no more; concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged. I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you. All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.

Here, Jesus again describes the ministry of the Holy Spirit to the church after Jesus is ascended to the Father. He makes this very remarkable statement that it is actually to our advantage that Jesus depart and the Holy Spirit come in his place. What could be more profitable (you would think) than having the personal presence of Jesus himself with us? But Jesus says, no, it is actually better for you – it is to your advantage – that the Holy Spirit will come, and he will declare to you the truth about me and will convict the world of sin and righteousness and judgment. It shows the importance and personal nature of the Holy Spirit.

Also, take a look at Romans 8:26-27. Here we have described the intercessory prayer ministry of the Holy Spirit on behalf of believers. Paul says,

Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with sighs too deep for words. And he who searches the hearts of men knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.

Here the Holy Spirit is clearly a person because he intercedes for the saints according to God’s will. Paul refers to the mind of the Spirit – God the Father knows what is in the mind of the Spirit, and the Spirit intercedes for us according to God’s will.

Once again, I think it is very clear that we are not dealing here with some kind of impersonal force or energy or power. This is a person. It is God himself. It is the third person of the Trinity.

Finally, this person is distinct from the Father and the Son. This is not the Father or the Son in a different guise or different role. This is a different person. Matthew 28:19 lists all three of the persons together – one of the great trinitarian verses in the New Testament. This is part of the Great Commission. Jesus says, “Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” All three of the persons are named in this baptismal formula – the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Similarly, in 2 Corinthians 13:14 we have all three of the persons mentioned in the same verse. The last benediction of this letter says, “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.” Here, as is typical “God” refers to God the Father, “Lord” refers to Jesus Christ, and then the Holy Spirit is mentioned. These are three distinct persons of the Trinity equally divine and equally personal.

B.  Attributes of Deity

Let’s talk now about some of the attributes that the Holy Spirit possesses.

1. Eternity is ascribed to the Holy Spirit in Hebrews 9:14. “How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify your conscience from dead works.” Here the attribute of being eternal is referred to with respect to the Holy Spirit.

2. Omnipresence is ascribed to the Holy Spirit in Psalm 139:7-8. The Spirit is all-present. “Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? Or whither shall I flee from thy presence? If I ascend to heaven, thou art there! If I make my bed in Sheol, thou art there!” Here he cannot escape the presence of the Spirit. No matter where he goes God, the Holy Spirit, is present there.

3. Omniscience is attributed to the Holy Spirit. 1 Corinthians 2:10-11. Here Paul says,

God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God. For what person knows a man’s thoughts except the spirit of the man which is in him? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.

This is a remarkable verse! Paul says that the Spirit searches even the depths of God and that the Spirit comprehends, encompasses, takes in, understands the thoughts of God himself. This would indicate that we are dealing here with someone who is omniscient.

4. Holiness is an attribute of the Spirit. That is obvious just in the name itself – the Holy Spirit. But we have this referred to specifically, for example, in Romans 1:4. Paul speaks of how Christ is “designated Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead.” Here the Holy Spirit is referred to as the Spirit of holiness.

5. The Holy Spirit is ascribed the attribute of love in Romans 5:5. Paul says, “Hope does not disappoint us because God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit which has been given to us.” So the Holy Spirit is not simply the source of power or guidance or strength; he is also the source of love. It is through the Holy Spirit that God’s love is poured into our hearts.

I think you can see that many attributes of deity are ascribed to the Holy Spirit – attributes like eternity, omnipresence, omniscience, holiness, and love--thereby underlining the deity of the Holy Spirit.

Next time we’ll begin to look at the relationship of the third person of the Trinity (the Holy Spirit) to the second person of the Trinity (Christ) and then examine the work of the Holy Spirit. I think you are going to be surprised to see how vitally involved the person of the Holy Spirit is in our Christian lives that we live today.

We’ve been talking about the ministry and the person of the Holy Spirit. Today we want to talk about the relation between the Holy Spirit and Christ, the second person of the Trinity. What you find is that the ministry of Jesus was empowered and permeated by the presence of the Holy Spirit.

C.  Relation to Christ

For example, the Holy Spirit is responsible for the virginal conception of Jesus. Look at Luke 1:35. Here Gabriel the angel says to Mary, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the most High will overshadow you. Therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God.” So the Holy Spirit is responsible for the virginal conception of Christ right at the very beginning.

Also in the beginning of Jesus’ earthly ministry we find the Holy Spirit present and active. Turn over to Luke 3:21-22. This is the public baptism of Jesus at which he begins his public ministry. We read, “Now when all the people were baptized and when Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the heaven was opened and the Holy Spirit descended upon him in bodily form as a dove, and a voice came from heaven, ‘Thou art my beloved Son, with thee I am well pleased.’” Here all three of the persons of the Trinity are present at the baptism of Jesus: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit who descends upon the Son at his baptism to empower him for the public ministry to which God had called him.

The miracles and the exorcisms that Jesus performed during his earthly ministry were done through the power of the Holy Spirit. Look at Acts 10:38. This is Peter’s sermon to Cornelius and his household. Peter speaks of “how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. How he went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.” Here it is through the power and anointing of the Holy Spirit that Jesus is able to carry out his miraculous healing ministry.

As for the exorcisms, turn over to Matthew 12:28. There Jesus says, “If it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.” So his power as an exorcist came through the anointing of the Holy Spirit that was upon him.

Not only his miraculous activity was empowered and anointed by the Holy Spirit but also Jesus’ preaching. Let’s go back to the Gospel of Luke 4:14-21:

And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and a report concerning him went out through all the surrounding country. And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.

And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up; and he went to the synagogue, as his custom was, on the sabbath day. And he stood up to read; and there was given to him the book of the prophet Isaiah. He opened the book and found the place where it was written,

“The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,
because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor.
He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives
and recovering of sight to the blind,
to set at liberty those who are oppressed,
to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.”

And he closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant, and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. And he began to say to them, “Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”

Wow! Here Jesus says that the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled in his ministry. So his preaching and teaching about the kingdom of God was also empowered and driven by the Holy Spirit.

Finally, the continuance of Jesus’ ministry after his resurrection and ascension to heaven is carried on by the Holy Spirit. John 16:7, 13-15:

Nevertheless I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Counselor will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.

. . .

When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you. All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.

So after Jesus is risen and ascended into heaven, during his absence from this space-time universe, it is the Holy Spirit who carries on and extends the ministry of Jesus during the church age until he comes again.

So I think you can see in the person and the work of Jesus the Holy Spirit is very actively involved. Certainly if Jesus himself needed the anointing and the power of the Holy Spirit to carry out the ministry which God had called him to do, how much more do we fallen and sinful people need the anointing power of the Holy Spirit to carry out the work that God has given us to do?

III.  Work of the Holy Spirit

Let’s turn now to an examination of some of the prominent ministries of the Holy Spirit. I think what we will find is a rather startling long list of ministries that the Holy Spirit has.

1. Old Testament Activities. There are many passages in the Old Testament referring to the Spirit of the Lord or the Spirit of God. For example, Genesis 1:2-3 says, “The Earth was without form and void, and darkness was on the face of the deep; and the Spirit of God was moving over the face of the waters. And God said, ‘Let there be light’; and there was light.” So right at the beginning of creation the Spirit of God is involved. But we should not assume that passages like this are referring to the Holy Spirit because in the Old Testament the person of the Holy Spirit had not yet been differentiated. Indeed, the name “the Holy Spirit” does not yet occur. So while God’s Spirit is very active in the Old Testament, we cannot confidently say that such passages are referring to the third person of the Trinity.

But when we come to the New Testament, now that the Holy Spirit has come to be distinguished, we may say pretty confidently that passages about the Spirit are referring to the Holy Spirit. Hermann Kleinknecht observes that the concept of a pneuma hagion is unattested in secular Greek literature. He says, “Here biblical Gk. has coined a new and distinctive expression for the very different, suprasensual, supraterrestrial and in part personal character and content which pneuma has in Judaism and Christianity.”[1] By contrast, “Profane Greek knows no hypostatic person of the Spirit understood as an independent divine entity.”

2. The Holy Spirit is involved in divine revelation. 1 Corinthians 2:9-10, 12-13. Paul says,

But, as it is written,

“What no eye has seen, nor ear heard,
nor the heart of man conceived,
what God has prepared for those who love him,”

God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God.

Then verse 12:

Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might understand the gifts bestowed on us by God. And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who possess the Spirit.

Here God, through the Holy Spirit, is revealing to us divine truths and enabling us to understand them.

3. The Holy Spirit is responsible for the inspiration of the Scriptures. 2 Peter 1:20-21, “First of all you must understand this, that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of one’s own interpretation, because no prophecy ever came by the impulse of man, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.” Here it describes the sustaining and moving power of the Holy Spirit in the inspiration of Scripture. If you’re interested in looking at that in more depth, I refer you back to the earlier lessons in Defenders when we talked about the doctrine of inspiration in our section on the Doctrine of Revelation.

4. The Holy Spirit is involved in the conception of Christ. Look at Luke 1:30-31, 34-35.

And the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. . . . And Mary said to the angel, “How shall this be, since I have no husband?” And the angel said to her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God.”

So the Holy Spirit is involved in Mary’s virginal conception of Jesus.

5. The Holy Spirit is responsible for the regeneration of believers, that is to say, for the new spiritual rebirth that we experience. John 3:5-7,

Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born anew.’”

Here Jesus describes the new birth – and the theological term for this is regeneration. The Holy Spirit is the one who makes a person spiritually alive, when before there was simply spiritual death. So it’s through the Holy Spirit that we are regenerated and thereby made fit for the kingdom of God. Apart from that regenerating work of the Holy Spirit, Jesus says, no one can enter God’s Kingdom.

6. Indwelling and baptizing of the believer. Romans 8:9. Here Paul describes the indwelling of the Holy Spirit that every believer enjoys. He says, “But you are not in the flesh, you are in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Any one who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him.” What Paul says is that it is the Holy Spirit within you that makes the decisive difference whether one is truly a Christian or not. Anyone who does not have the indwelling Holy Spirit is not a Christian. He is unregenerate. But anyone who has the Holy Spirit dwelling within him is a regenerate believer and therefore belongs to Christ.

1 Corinthians 12:13 makes the same point. It says, “For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit.” Paul here says that it is through being baptized in the Holy Spirit that we are placed into the body of Christ. The reason that we are members of the body of Christ is because of this baptism of the Holy Spirit which has identified us with Christ as one of his members. Through the baptism and indwelling of the Holy Spirit we believers belong to Christ and are part of his body.

7. The Holy Spirit gives us assurance of salvation. Romans 8:14-16. Paul says,

For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the spirit of sonship. When we cry, “Abba! Father!” it is the Spirit himself bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God . . . .

So how do you have assurance of your salvation? How do you know that you’re a child of God, born again? It is because of the witness of the Holy Spirit with your spirit. This is the source of your assurance that you are a regenerate and redeemed Christian.

8. The Holy Spirit gives enablement for spiritual living. Galatians 5:16-18, 25. Here Paul says,

But I say, walk by the Spirit, and do not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, to prevent you from doing what you would. But if you are led by the Spirit you are not under the law. . . . If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.

So it is through daily walking in the Spirit – walking in the power of the Holy Spirit – that we can combat and live above the desires of the flesh which would pull us down and mire us in sin and stain our lives with unholy living. It is through the power of the Holy Spirit that we are enabled to live the Christian life. The Christian life cannot be successfully lived in the power of the flesh. That’s why Christians who are not walking in the power of the Holy Spirit are so miserable and so defeated in their Christian walk because in the power of the flesh you cannot successfully live the Christian life. You need the power of the Holy Spirit.

9. The Holy Spirit is the source of spiritual gifts for building up the body of Christ. 1 Corinthians 12:4-11. Here Paul describes some of the gifts that the Holy Spirit gives. He says,

Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are varieties of service, but the same Lord; and there are varieties of working, but it is the same God who inspires them all in every one. To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. To one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the ability to distinguish between spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. All these are inspired by one and the same Spirit, who apportions to each one individually as he wills.

According to Paul, the Holy Spirit has gifted the church with all of these special spiritual abilities distributed according to his will to operate for the building up of the body of Christ. That means that you have a spiritual gift that the Holy Spirit has bestowed upon you which you are to be exercising in the context of your local Christian community.

10. The fruit of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit produces spiritual fruit in our lives. Galatians 5:22-24. After listing the works of the flesh, Paul then goes on to say in verse 22,

But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such there is no law. And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.

So the manifestation of the Holy Spirit is not, properly speaking, the spiritual gifts. Everyone is given a spiritual gift for serving the body of Christ, but the way the Holy Spirit is manifested in the life of someone who’s walking in the Spirit is the production of these character qualities, these virtues, that are produced in the person, like love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, gentleness, and so forth. These are the real fruit or signs of the filling of the Holy Spirit in a person’s life.

You look at this list of prominent ministries of the Holy Spirit and I think you can’t help but ask yourself, how in the world could the Holy Spirit have ever become the forgotten person to the Trinity? He’s there right from the beginning and is absolutely vital in every respect of the Christian life.

IV.  The presence of the Spirit in the Old and New Covenants

Today we want to turn to a discussion of the role of the Holy Spirit in the Old Covenant in contrast to the role played by the Holy Spirit in the New Covenant.

A.  Old Covenant

Prior to Pentecost, which is the hinge of history with regard to the ministry of the Holy Spirit in the world, God’s Spirit would come upon persons to indwell them to perform some special specific task – some appointed task that God had in mind for them. There are numerous examples of this in the Old Testament. Let’s just read about some of these.

Exodus 31:1-3 and then Exodus 35:30-35,

The LORD said to Moses, “See, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah: and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with ability and intelligence, with knowledge and all craftsmanship.”

It goes on to describe how God had gifted this man in order to be the designer and constructor of the tabernacle. This is expanded on in Exodus 35:30-35:

And Moses said to the people of Israel, “See, the LORD has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; and he has filled him with the Spirit of God, with ability, with intelligence, with knowledge, and with all craftsmanship, to devise artistic designs, to work in gold and silver and bronze, in cutting stones for setting, and in carving wood, for work in every skilled craft. And he has inspired him to teach, both him and Oholiab the son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan. He has filled them with ability to do every sort of work done by a craftsman or by a designer or by an embroiderer in blue and purple and scarlet stuff and fine twined linen, or by a weaver – by any sort of workman or skilled designer.”

Here in a very practical way God had filled with his Spirit these men to do artistic crafts in wood and gems and stone and cloth for the equipping and decoration of the tabernacle. This would be a good example of a specific place where the Spirit was put upon someone to carry out a specific job and giving him the ability to do that.

Now turn over to Numbers 11:16-17, 25. Here Moses needs help in judging the people of Israel in settling their disputes:

And the LORD said to Moses, “Gather for me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and officers over them; and bring them to the tent of meeting, and let them take their stand there with you. And I will come down and talk with you there; and I will take some of the spirit which is upon you and put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you may not bear it yourself alone.” . . . Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke to him, and took some of the spirit that was upon him and put it upon the seventy elders; and when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied. But they did so no more.

Here you see how the Spirit of God comes down and anoints the seventy elders to do the same work that God had anointed Moses to do by his Spirit.

During the period of the judges prior to the monarchy in Israel there was a series of judges that would arise in Israel that would serve to deliver the people from their enemies, to bring them back to the true way. These judges were typically anointed by the Spirit of God to do what God had called them to do. So look, for example, at Judges 3:9-10:

But when the people of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer for the people of Israel, who delivered them, Othni-el the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother. The Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel; he went out to war, and the LORD gave Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed over Cushan-rishathaim.

So here Othni-el is one of these judges upon whom the Spirit of the Lord came so that he could prevail over the enemies threatening Israel.

Turn over to Judges 6:34 for another example. This is one of the most famous of the judges – Gideon: “But the Spirit of the LORD took possession of Gideon; and he sounded the trumpet, and the Abiezrites were called out to follow him.” Then it describes the great triumph that Gideon and his small army had over the enemies of Israel. So Gideon was also anointed by the Spirit of the LORD to do what God called him to do – to deliver Israel.

Judges 11:29. This is the case of Jephthah. “Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh, and passed on to Mizpah of Gilead, and from Mizpah of Gilead he passed on to the Ammonites.” Jephthah also defeats the enemies of Israel.

Judges 13:24-25. This is the part of the story of Samson who was also one of the judges.

And the woman bore a son, and called his name Samson; and the boy grew, and the LORD blessed him. And the Spirit of the LORD began to stir him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshta-ol.

Here the Spirit of the Lord comes on Samson to do the great deeds that he was called upon to do. Some of these are described, for example, in Judges 14:5-6.

Then Samson went down with his father and mother to Timnah, and he came to the vineyards of Timnah. And behold, a young lion roared against him; and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he tore the lion asunder as one tears a kid; and he had nothing in his hand.

Here Sampson, barehanded, rips this lion to pieces because the Spirit of the LORD had come upon him to equip him to do that. Then in verse 19 we see again how he conquers the enemies of Israel. Verse 19:

And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon and killed thirty men of the town, and took their spoil and gave the festal garments to those who had told the riddle.

Finally in Judges 15:14-15,

When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him; and the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, and the ropes which were on his arms became as flax that has caught fire, and his bonds melted off his hands. And he found a fresh jawbone of an ass, and put out his hand and seized it, and with it he slew a thousand men.

Here’s the famous slaughter with the jawbone of an ass that Samson does because, again, the Spirit of the LORD had come mightily upon him.

This is the pattern in the Old Covenant. The Spirit of the LORD would come upon appointed individuals for a specific task and a limited time to enable them to do that task to which God had called them.

What we will do next time is look more closely at the contrast between the Old Covenant and the New Covenant. I think we will see that what corresponds to the temple in the Old Covenant (where the glory of God, the power of God, dwelt most specifically) is in the new covenant the believer’s body. We are the temple of the Holy Spirit. We’ll see that contrast next time.

IV.  The presence of the Spirit in the Old and New Covenants

         B.  New Covenant

We’ve been thinking about the role of the Holy Spirit in the old covenant, and now we want to contrast that with the role of the Holy Spirit in the new covenant. This can perhaps be best done by means of a timeline. Let’s imagine a timeline on which the left side represents the Old Testament covenant and the right side is the New Testament. The division between these two would come at the cross of Christ. Jesus said at his Last Supper that he was inaugurating a new covenant in his blood. This was the covenant prophesied by the prophet Jeremiah. So the transition between the old and new covenants occurs with the death of Christ. But the effects of that transition are not immediate. There is a transitional period following the cross which is described in the book of Acts in which we have a transition from the old to the new.

The key verse here is Acts 1:8. There Jesus says, “You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and all Judea, and Samaria, and to the end of the Earth.” Here Jesus describes the bestowal of the Holy Spirit upon the New Testament church in a progressive series of events beginning first in Jerusalem and Judea, and then Samaria, and then the uttermost parts of the Earth, which would be the Gentile world.

In the book of Acts you see this progression unfolding. For example, in Acts chapter 2 you have the fulfillment of the promise to Jerusalem and to Judea where at Pentecost the Holy Spirit is bestowed upon the disciples. Then in Acts chapter 8 you have the bestowal of the Holy Spirit upon the Samaritans, who were a mixture of Jewish and non-Jewish people, so hybrids in between the Jews and the Gentiles. Then finally in Acts chapter 10 and 11 and 19 you have the bestowal of the Holy Spirit on Gentiles, such as the Roman centurion Cornelius’ household, as well as on certain Ephesian disciples of John the Baptist whom Paul encounters in Acts 19.

So in the book of Acts you see this fulfillment of the promise of Acts 1:8 progressively unfolding: first Jerusalem and Judea, then Samaria, and then finally to non-Jewish peoples – to the Gentiles.

In the old covenant the locus of the Holy Spirit was in the temple or the tabernacle, specifically in the Holy of Holies (or the most holy place; the inner sanctum of the temple). 2 Chronicles 7:1-3. describes the special presence of God in the Holy of Holies in the temple.

When Solomon had ended his prayer, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of the Lord filled the temple. And the priests could not enter the house of the Lord, because the glory of the Lord filled the Lord’s house. When all the children of Israel saw the fire come down and the glory of the Lord upon the temple, they bowed down with their faces to the earth on the pavement, and worshiped and gave thanks to the Lord, saying, “For he is good, for his steadfast love endures for ever.”

Here at the dedication of Solomon’s temple the presence of the Lord comes down in a special manifest way to abide in the temple. Eventually when the nation of Israel was judged by God, before he brought in the Babylonian armies to conquer and destroy Israel in judgment, his presence withdrew from the temple, leaving them abandoned to their enemies. We read about this in Ezekiel 9:3, “Now the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherubim on which it rested to the threshold of the house.” There the glory of the Lord which rested on the cherubim inside the Holy of Holies – they were figurines overshadowing the Ark of the Covenant that was in the Holy of Holies containing the Mosaic law – went out from the Holy of Holies to the threshold of the house. God’s presence was leaving Israel. Then in Ezekiel 11:23 we read, “And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.” Here now the glory of God departs from the temple to the Mount of Olives. This is the mountain on the east side of the city. Slowly God’s presence was leaving Israel and abandoning them to the judgment of their enemies, as the Babylonian hordes would come in and destroy Israel.

The presence of God did not simply rest in the tabernacle or in the temple; there were special anointings of the Holy Spirit that would come upon individual people for specific tasks, such as prophecy. For example, look at 1 Peter 1:10-11. Peter says,

The prophets who prophesied of the grace that was to be yours searched and inquired about this salvation; they inquired what person or time was indicated by the Spirit of Christ within them when predicting the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glory.

Here Peter says that when these prophets spoke about the coming of the Messiah it was the Spirit of Christ within them that was giving them utterance.

So the Holy Spirit abode in the temple in the Holy of Holies in a special way, but then would also anoint people for special acts such as prophecy.

1.  Permanence of presence in believer

In the New Testament, what corresponds to the temple? Since the Jewish temple was destroyed, God does not abide any longer in the temple. Rather, according to the New Testament, the temple of the Holy Spirit in the New Covenant is the individual believer. We are the temple of the Holy Spirit. And what effects the transition between these two is called the baptism of the Holy Spirit. In virtue of being baptized by the Holy Spirit we now become the abiding place of the Holy Spirit, the equivalent, as it were, to the temple in the old covenant. And so we have, for example, statements like 1 Corinthians 6:19-20. Paul says, “Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, which you have from God? You are not your own; you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body.” There Paul indicates that our bodies are now temples of the Holy Spirit, indwelt by him.

The same thing is taught in the book of Hebrews, Hebrews 3:5-6. Here the author says, “Now Moses was faithful in all God’s house as a servant, to testify to the things that were to be spoken later, but Christ was faithful over God’s house as a son. And we are his house if we hold fast our confidence and pride in our hope.” Here, just as Moses was faithful over the house of God in the Old Covenant, Christ is faithful over God’s house, and we are his house. We are the house of God now, as he abides in us as his temple.

For the fact that it is the baptism of the Holy Spirit that effects the transition between these two, look at verses such as Luke 3:16. This is the preaching of John the Baptist prior to the advent of Jesus.

John answered them all, “I baptize you with water; but he who is mightier than I is coming, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie; he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.

John was carrying out a baptism of water, but he predicted one who was coming after him who would baptize people with the Holy Spirit.

Turn over to Acts 1:4-5 to see the fulfillment of John the Baptist’s prophecy. Now it is Jesus who,

. . . charged them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, he said, “you heard from me, for John baptized with water, but before many days you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.”

Then we have in Pentecost the fulfillment of that in chapter 2 when the Holy Spirit comes and rests upon the disciples and they speak in other languages.

Two more references to the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Acts 11:15-16. Here Peter is describing his experience in preaching the Gospel to Cornelius’ household,

As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as on us at the beginning. And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, “John baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.”

So Peter thinks of the experience of Cornelius and his household as being the same experience that he and the disciples had at Pentecost. It is the baptism of the Holy Spirit.

Finally, 1 Corinthians 12:13, “For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body – Jews or Greeks, slaves or free – and all were made to drink of one Spirit.” According to this verse, it is by the baptism of the Holy Spirit that we are incorporated into the body of Christ, that we become part of his church, part of his body.

So the baptism of the Holy Spirit is what turns a person into a temple of God indwelt by the Holy Spirit. When you look at the unfolding of the book of Acts you see this happen progressively over time. First Jerusalem and Judea (at Pentecost, the disciples are baptized in the Holy Spirit), then in Acts chapter 8 (Samaritan persons receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit), and then in Acts 10 and 11 you have Gentiles who are baptized in the Holy Spirit and also become part of the body of Christ.

We now want to look at the baptism of the Holy Spirit in more detail, since this is a matter of tremendous confusion in the contemporary church as a result of the Pentecostal and Charismatic movements. But I think that that will be better reserved for next time. We will take up in more detail the nature of the baptism of the Holy Spirit of which we’ve spoken briefly here.

B. 2. Baptism and Fullness of the Holy Spirit

Today we want to look in greater detail at the baptism and fullness of the Holy Spirit. There’s a great deal of confusion in Protestant circles concerning the baptism of the Holy Spirit because certain Pentecostal and charismatic Christians claim that the baptism of the Holy Spirit is a second work of grace in the life of the believer which brings one into a fuller and deeper experience of the Holy Spirit. They believe that when a person becomes a Christian he is indwelt by the Spirit, but he is not baptized in the Holy Spirit. In order to come into this deeper walk with God, you need to have a second work of grace – a second experience of the Holy Spirit – called the baptism of the Holy Spirit, often accompanied by speaking in tongues, which will initiate you into this deeper walk in the Spirit.

I think this view is completely wrong. It seems to me that the Scripture is relatively clear that the baptism of the Holy Spirit is not a second work of grace, but it is an initiatory work of the Spirit by means of which we are placed into the body of Christ. It is through the baptism of the Holy Spirit that we are indwelt by the Spirit and made to be members of the body of Christ. 1 Corinthians 12:13 seems to make that clear: “For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit.” Here the baptism of the Holy Spirit is the universal experience of the church, the initiating act by means of which we are placed into the body of Christ.

Charismatics will usually appeal to the stories in the book of Acts to show that the baptism of the Holy Spirit is not an initiatory act but is a second work of grace. But, in fact, a close examination of those stories in the book of Acts reveals that in every single case it is clearly an initial experience of the Holy Spirit that is being described and not a second experience.

For example, in Acts 2 you have the story of Pentecost where the gift of the Holy Spirit is given to the church in Jerusalem and Judea. In Acts 1.4-5 we read

And while staying with them he charged them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, he said, “you heard from me, for John baptized with water, but before many days you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.”

Clearly, they had not yet received the promise of the Father, which was the anticipated baptism of the Holy Spirit. They were not to leave Jerusalem until they received this baptism in the Holy Spirit. At Pentecost they received this promise, and Luke says, “they were all filled with the Holy Spirit” (Acts 2.4). The only basis, for doubting that this is the initial bestowal of the Holy Spirit upon them, would be John’s story of Jesus’ resurrection appearance in the upper room when Jesus breathes on the disciples and says, “Receive the Holy Spirit” (Jn 20.22). But notice that John does not say that they received the Holy Spirit at that time, nor did they leave Jerusalem to embark upon their mission. Rather Jesus’ saying is plausibly understood as a command similar to that given in Luke to receive the Holy Spirit.

In Acts 8 you have the story of how the Holy Spirit is given to the Samaritan believers. Again, a close reading of chapter 8 indicates that they did not have the Holy Spirit until they were baptized in the Holy Spirit. Luke says the Jerusalem apostles “sent to them Peter and John,  who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit;  for it had not yet fallen on any of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit. 

The incident is strange because the people did not receive the Holy Spirit until after their water baptism. But the delay may have been due to the fact that the giving of the Holy Spirit to the Samaritans needed to be authorized by the church in Jerusalem in order to be seen as valid. What is undeniable is that their experience of the Holy Spirit was an initial experience, not a second one.

Then in Acts 10 and 11 we have the story of Cornelius and his household in which the Holy Spirit now is given to the Gentiles. And once again this is clearly an initial act of the Holy Spirit in the lives of Cornelius and his household. In Acts 11.15 Peter says that “the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as on us [at Pentecost] in the beginning.” Again, it is clear that Cornelius and his household had not previously received the gift to the Holy Spirit.

Then in Acts 19.1-6 we have a very strange story of the Ephesian disciples of John the Baptist.

Paul passed through the upper country and came to Ephesus. There he found some disciples. 2 And he said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” And they said, “No, we have never even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.” 3 And he said, “Into what then were you baptized?” They said, “Into John’s baptism.” 4 And Paul said, “John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, Jesus.” 5 On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 6 And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.

Obviously, they had not received the Holy Spirit when they submitted to the baptism of John the Baptist. In fact they say, “We haven't even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.” So this is obviously not a second work of the Holy Spirit

So, although the baptism of the Holy Spirit in these cases is differently related to water baptism (sometimes preceding it; sometimes independent of it; sometimes actually coming after water baptism), nevertheless it is clear that in every case the persons who experience a baptism of the Holy Spirit are experiencing an initial act of the Holy Spirit and not some sort of secondary act of grace which puts them into a deeper walk with Christ.

So, it is through the baptism of the Holy Spirit that we are placed into the body of Christ, regenerated, born again to new life, and indwelt with the Holy Spirit. Every believer has the Holy Spirit dwelling within him. Romans 8:9-10:

But you are not in the flesh, you are in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Any one who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. But if Christ is in you, although your bodies are dead because of sin, your spirits are alive because of righteousness.

According to this passage, it is the presence of the Holy Spirit that makes the difference whether a person is a Christian or not a Christian. It is the presence of the Holy Spirit that makes a person a member of the body of Christ and a Christian.

Also in 1 Corinthians 3:16, Paul says, “Do you not know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in you?” The Holy Spirit is the permanent possession of every believer. He is what makes us regenerate – what makes us Christians. Anyone who does not have the Holy Spirit does not belong to him and is not a Christian.

B. 3 Fullness of the Holy Spirit

Although every Christian is baptized and indwelt by the Holy Spirit, not every Christian is filled with the Holy Spirit. There is a significant difference between being indwelt with the Holy Spirit and filled with the Holy Spirit. Look at 1 Corinthians 2:14-3:3. Paul says,

The unspiritual man does not receive the gifts of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned. The spiritual man judges all things, but is himself to be judged by no one. “For who has known the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?” But we have the mind of Christ.

But I, brethren, could not address you as spiritual men, but as men of the flesh, as babes in Christ. I fed you with milk, not solid food; for you were not ready for it; and even yet you are not ready, for you are still of the flesh. For while there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not of the flesh, and behaving like ordinary men?

Then also in 1 Corinthians 3:11-15. Paul says,

For no other foundation can any one lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if any one builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw— each man’s work will become manifest; for the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done. If the work which any man has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward. If any man’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire.

Here Paul seems to describe people who are Christians but who are still dominated by the flesh, that is to say, the fallen human nature. He calls them carnal or men of the flesh. He says that their works are not like gold and silver and precious stones that will endure testing, but they are like wood, hay, and stubble that will be burned up and destroyed, though they themselves will be saved. What Paul seems to contemplate here are three different kinds of people. There’s the natural man, who is the unregenerate man. He does not have the Spirit of God. He is living in the power of the flesh – the fallen human nature. Then there is the spiritual man. This is the regenerate Christian who is living in the power of the Holy Spirit. And then there is the carnal man, or man of the flesh, who is regenerate (he has the Spirit of God) but still living in the power of the flesh – the fallen human nature – and so is immature and experiences futility.

Notice what the sign or evidence is of the spiritual man. It is not charismatic gifts. The church in Corinth exhibited all sorts of charismatic gifts, didn't it? Speaking in tongues, miracles, other sorts of charismatic phenomena. Yet it is the most carnal church in the New Testament. People were getting drunk at the communion services. A man was living in an incestuous relationship with his step-mother. It was riven with strife and jealousy and party spirit. So even though the charismatic gifts were highly abundant and evident in Corinth, this was not a church that was under the direction and power of the Holy Spirit. So the sign of the spiritual person is not charismatic gifts. Rather, it is the fruit of the Holy Spirit which are produced in a person's life in the place of the works of the flesh. That is what we saw when we looked at Galatians 5:16-25. Paul says,

But I say, walk by the Spirit, and do not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, to prevent you from doing what you would. But if you are led by the Spirit you are not under the law. Now the works of the flesh are plain: fornication, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, anger, selfishness, dissension, party spirit, envy, drunkenness, carousing, and the like. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such there is no law. And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.

So the evidence of the Spirit-filled life is not charismatic gifts like speaking in tongues. The evidence of the Spirit-filled life will be the fruit of the Holy Spirit that is produced in a person's life instead of the works of the flesh.

Unfortunately, as we've seen, we do not always experience the fullness of the Holy Spirit. What does it mean to be filled with the Holy Spirit? I think that it means to be, not only indwelt by the Spirit, but to be empowered and controlled by the Holy Spirit. If we say that someone is filled with rage or filled with jealousy, we mean that person is controlled and possessed by that anger or by that jealousy. In the same way, when Paul says to be filled with the Holy Spirit, he is telling us to be controlled and empowered by the Holy Spirit, so that he will produce in our lives the fruit of the Holy Spirit that is described in Galatians.

The question, then, is this: why is it that many Christians are not filled with the Holy Spirit? Why is it that so many Christians seem to fall into that category of carnal Christians – Christians who are still living under the domination and influence of the fallen human nature? Let me suggest two reasons as to why many Christians are not filled with the Holy Spirit.

1. A lack of total commitment. In other words, these persons, though they are Christians, are not really sold out 100% to Christ. This lack of total commitment, I think, prevents the fullness of the Holy Spirit in their life and leaves them in the power the flesh.

Look at Jesus’ very familiar parable of the sower in Mark 4. In Mark verses 3-9 Jesus gives the parable of the sower and then in verses 14-20 he gives its interpretation.

“Listen! A sower went out to sow. And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it. Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it had not much soil, and immediately it sprang up, since it had no depth of soil; and when the sun rose it was scorched, and since it had no root it withered away. Other seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain. And other seeds fell into good soil and brought forth grain, growing up and increasing and yielding thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.” And he said, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”

Thus the parable of the sower. In verses 14-20 Jesus interprets this parable for us. He says,

The sower sows the word. And these are the ones along the path, where the word is sown; when they hear, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word which is sown in them. And these in like manner are the ones sown upon rocky ground, who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy; and they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away. And others are the ones sown among thorns; they are those who hear the word, but the cares of the world, and the delight in riches, and the desire for other things, enter in and choke the word, and it proves unfruitful. But those that were sown upon the good soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit, thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.

I want to draw your attention to that third kind of soil – the seed that is sown among thorns. These persons receive the word, but they are not fruitful. They don’t bear grain. They are living, but they are not a fruitful type of plant. What is the difference between these people and the people who are the good soil that bears fruit thirty, sixty, a hundredfold? Jesus identifies three things that choke out the word and make them unfruitful:

1. The cares of the world (that is to say, just the pressures and the vicissitudes of life that drag them down).

2. The delight in riches (the desire for monetary gain; for affluence).

3. The desire for other things (their heart’s desire is not for God, not for the kingdom).

These three features conspire to make these people unfruitful: the cares of the world, the delight in riches, and the desire for other things.

The contrast to this type of person, I think, is found in The Sermon on the Mount, where in Matthew 6:33 Jesus says, “Seek first his Kingdom and his righteousness and all these things shall be yours as well.” Here Jesus says that your focus is not to be upon worldly things, upon prosperity, upon material things. Rather we are to seek first God’s Kingdom and its righteousness. That is in contrast, I think, to those who are represented by the third type of soil who lack this kind of total commitment. Their commitment is not first and foremost to God and his kingdom and his righteousness; rather they have a desire for other things and are burdened with the cares of this world. This, I think, explains why many Christians are not Spirit-filled, fruitful Christians.

The prescription for being that good soil – that type of person who seeks first the Kingdom of God and its righteousness – is found, I think, in Romans 12:1-2. This gives the prescription for this kind of life. Paul says,

I appeal to you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that you may prove what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.

Here Paul describes a person who is totally committed to God, body and soul. His body is committed to God as a living sacrifice, and then he is transformed by the renewal of his mind. So body and soul are sold out to Christ.

The result is that you can discern what is the will of God. Notice what the will of God is. It is characterized by three adjectives: it is good, it is acceptable, and it is perfect. You don’t need to be afraid of God’s will for your life. God’s will is good for you. If you could fully understand it, you would recognize to be good. It would be acceptable, not only acceptable to God but acceptable to you as well. And it would be perfect. That means there’s nothing you can do to improve upon it. Any efforts you could make to improve upon God’s will for your life would only damage it because it’s already perfect. So there’s no reason not to be totally committed to Christ in the way that Paul describes – as a living sacrifice, body and soul, given to him and so bearing fruit through the Holy Spirit directing and controlling your life.

I think one of the reasons that many Christians are not filled with the Holy Spirit is due to a lack of total commitment on their part. But that’s not the only reason.

2. There is a reliance upon self-effort that frustrates the attempt to lead a Spirit-filled life. Some people may indeed be totally committed to Christ. They are sold out to Christ, but they are attempting to live the Christian life on their own strength, in their own power, that is to say, in the power of the flesh. And that is futile. The Christian life is impossible to lead in the power of the flesh. It cannot be done through self-effort. This is what Jesus teaches us in the parable of the vine and the branches in John 15:4-5. Jesus says,

Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in me, and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.

It couldn’t be clearer, could it? The branch severed from the vine is powerless to produce fruit. It only withers and dies. The secret to bearing fruit is to be abiding in the vine. As the life of the vine courses through the branches they will naturally become fruitful. So it is a matter not of self-effort but rather a matter of abiding in Christ.

Notice that after Jesus’ resurrection the disciples were told to tarry in Jerusalem until they are endowed with the power of the Holy Spirit. Acts 1:4-8.

And while staying with them he charged them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, he said, “you heard from me, for John baptized with water, but before many days you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit. . . . But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the end of the earth.”

Here the Holy Spirit is the secret to the power to be effective witnesses for Christ throughout the world. To go out on your own, to try to live the Christian life without the power of the Holy Spirit, is futile and hopeless.

The secret to the fruitful Christian life is allowing Christ to live out his life through us. This is what Paul talks about in Galatians 2:20. Paul says, “I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me; and the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.” This is the same truth that is expressed in the parable of the vine and the branches. Christ is the vine; we are the branches. It is Christ living through us that enables us to have a fruitful Christian existence.

Without the filling of the Holy Spirit (which is described here by saying Christ is living in me, that is to say, the Holy Spirit of Christ living in me) the Christian life is reduced to legalism and grinding self-effort. Therefore the non-Christian will actually often be happier than the Christian who is living a defeated Christian experience in the power of the flesh.

This, I think, was described no better than in the following testimony that I want to read from a Christian minister who apostatized and walked away from Christ and became a non-Christian. He contrasts his life as a Christian with the life that he now has as an apostate. I think you will hear a perfect description of the carnal Christian existence lived in the power of the flesh. This is what he says.

Since I’m passionate about the things I’m interested in, I tried as best as I could to be a faithful Christian, and good minister. I accepted God’s grace, and it radically changed my life when I was a teenager. After being saved I wanted to show God how grateful I was for his gift of salvation by committing my life over to him with all I had. Even though I knew it was by grace that I had been saved, I almost always felt guilty that I wasn’t doing enough in response to God’s love. Whether it was spending time in prayer, evangelizing, reading the Bible, tithing, forgiving someone who had done me wrong, or whether it was struggling with temptations of lust, pride, selfishness and laziness, I almost always felt guilty. . . . I never could understand how Christian people could come to church every Sunday but never get involved much in the Church’s programs, because that’s what believers should want to do, as I did.

. . .

Today I am pretty much guilt free in the sense that I have no guilt in regards to the Christian duties mentioned above. In fact, I can’t remember when I have ever been happier than I am today. . . . I’m living life to the hilt, pretty much guilt free, primarily because my ethical standards aren’t as high. In fact, I believe the Christian ethical standards are simply impossible for anyone to measure up to. Think about it, according to Jesus I should feel guilty for not just what I do, but for what I think about, lusting, hating, coveting, etc. I’d like every person . . . to experience the freedom I have found.

That, I think, is a perfect description of the carnal Christian life lived in the power of the flesh through self-effort. It is a miserable, guilt-ridden, works-oriented type of lifestyle. A lifestyle that is less fulfilling than being a non-Christian where you don’t have to worry about these sorts of ethical duties and concerns.

I think the fundamental failure of this ex-Christian is that he did not understand that the Christian life is primarily about being, not doing. For him, the Christian life was primarily about what he did for God to show his gratitude to God. It was all about doing, all about performance, and not about being and about abiding in Christ in the life of the vine, enjoying the grace of God and the forgiveness of God that enables one to have that source of power in life.

Certainly someone who is focused on being in Christ will be involved in doing. Of course he will! He’ll be involved in evangelism and giving and acts of mercy and so forth. But those acts will not be the basis of the Christian life. They will be the overflow of an abundant life that is connected to the life of the vine and so naturally produces this kind of fruit.

I want to suggest that those two reasons may be why many Christians don’t experience the fullness of the Holy Spirit in their lives. Either there is a lack of total commitment (they are not really sold out; the desire for other things, for material gain, the pressures of life choke out the word in them and make them unfruitful) or else they are trying to live the Christian life in their own power and that results in futility, guilt, and a grinding legalism.

That raises the question then: how can I be filled with the Holy Spirit? I want to suggest that it’s a very simple matter of repentance and faith. Repent and believe.

First of all, repent. We need to confess to God the known sin that is in our lives. We need to come honestly before him and acknowledge the sin that he convicts us of. 1 John 1:9 gives this promise: “If we confess our sins he is faithful and just and will forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” So the first thing to do is to repent. Quit hiding from God, quit rationalizing your sin, but confess known sin to God, acknowledging it before him.

That’s the negative aspect. The positive aspect is to believe. That is to say, to yield oneself to God as a living sacrifice in the way that Paul prescribes in Romans 12:1-2. Body and soul yielded to God as a sacrificial offering. This is not dependent upon emotions or feelings, which come and go. This is a commitment of the will.

Then, having made that total commitment of yielding yourself to God as a living sacrifice, then we need to walk in the Spirit on a daily basis – to log time in the Spirit. We need to practice immediate confession of sin and resurrender of our lives to God. Being filled with the Holy Spirit is not a sort of permanent status that a Christian enjoys. Rather, one can, through sin, retake control of one’s life. You need in that case to practice confession again, claim 1 John 1:9, and then resurrender your life to God. This is the difference between a living sacrifice and the sacrifices in the Old Testament. In the Old Testament the animal sacrifices were slaughtered before they were presented to the Lord. They were dead! But Paul says present yourself as a living sacrifice. That is much more difficult, right? Because a living sacrifice tends to crawl off the altar! So this is a life that needs to be continually resurrendered daily to God through immediate confession of sin and re-commitment.

The Scripture indicates that as Christians we can grieve the Holy Spirit through sin. Ephesians 4:30. Paul says, “Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.” You are indwelt with the Holy Spirit. Paul says don’t grieve the Holy Spirit. The context of Ephesians 4 makes it evident that we do that through sin in our lives. By sinning we grieve the Holy Spirit and so lose his fullness.

Not only that, however, we can also quench the Holy Spirit’s work in our lives through disobedience. 1 Thessalonians 5:19. Paul says, “Do not quench the Spirit.” I think the difference between grieving the Spirit and quenching the Spirit is that grieving the Holy Spirit is done through sin whereas quenching the Holy Spirit involves not following the Holy Spirit but suppressing his activity in your life. The context of 1 Thessalonians 5 is the command, “don’t despise prophesying.” Don’t try to quench the Spirit in your life. We quench the Spirit when the Holy Spirit is leading us to do something and we refuse to do it, or we feel his conviction that something needs to change and we quench it and suppress it. By doing that we will forfeit his power and direction in our lives.

We need as Christians to be continually confessing our sins and resurrendering the control of our lives to God so as to not grieve or quench the Holy Spirit through sin or disobedience.

This involves a daily commitment. Every day that you get up, before you roll out of bed and your feet hit the floor, just say a prayer, “Lord take control of the throne of my life today. Live out your life through me. Fill me with your Holy Spirit. Direct and control me today.”

Jan gives a wonderful illustration of this truth of walking in the Holy Spirit. She thinks of it as a sort of umbrella through which you walk through life’s storms. As long as you stay under God’s umbrella you’ll be safe in the storms of life. That doesn’t mean you won’t suffer, but you’ll be where God wants you to be – you’ll be in his will. But if you stray off the path or go outside the umbrella then you are apt to go into the ditch or into disaster because you no longer walking in the will of God for you. So we want to stay under that umbrella of God’s will along life’s way. That will be done by allowing the Holy Spirit to empower and direct us day by day as we go along life’s path.

For those who wish to make such a commitment right now, let’s close in prayer.

Our Father in heaven, we thank you that though we are sinful and fallen creatures that you love us so much and that Christ died for those sins to free us from guilt and punishment and to impute to us his righteousness. Thank you that as we are clothed in his blood we stand righteous and forgiven before you. And now Lord, in the best way that we know how, we want to yield our lives to you as living sacrifices. Our bodies pure and dedicated to you. Our souls given over to renewal through the transforming power of your Holy Spirit. Lord Jesus, we pray that you would live out your life through us. Help us to abide in you as the branches abide in the vine and so to bear much fruit. Holy Spirit of God, we pray that you would take control of our lives, direct us and empower us to live lives that are full of your fruit and that are pleasing to our God and Father. Through Jesus Christ Our Lord, Amen.
