# Work of the Holy Spirit

---

## A “Startling” List of Ministries

* The Spirit is everywhere in Christian doctrine and life
* The Spirit’s work is not a narrow “add-on” to salvation
  * Creation and providence
  * Revelation and Scripture
  * Salvation’s application (new birth, indwelling, assurance)
  * Sanctification and fruit
  * Empowering and gifting the church

---

## (1–3) Scripture and Revelation

* OT: God’s “Spirit” is active (e.g., Gen 1:2), though the personhood is less differentiated
* The Spirit reveals God’s truth (1 Cor 2:9–13)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“But as it is written: ‘Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, Nor have entered into the heart of man The things which God has prepared for those who love Him.’ But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God. […] These things we also speak, not in words which man’s wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>1 Corinthians 2:9–13 (NKJV)</em></p>

* The Spirit inspires Scripture (2 Pet 1:20–21)
  * “Men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God"

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation, for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit.”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>2 Peter 1:20–21 (NKJV)</em></p>

---

## (4–7) Salvation Applied

* Conception of Christ (Lk 1:35)
* Regeneration / new birth (Jn 3:5–7)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“Jesus answered, ‘Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.’”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>John 3:5–7 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Indwelling and Spirit-baptism as belonging to Christ (Rom 8:9; 1 Cor 12:13)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His.” (Rom 8:9)</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Romans 8:9 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free—and have all been made to drink into one Spirit.” (1 Cor 12:13)</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>1 Corinthians 12:13 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Assurance of salvation (Rom 8:14–16)
  * The Spirit bears witness with our spirit

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. […] The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Romans 8:14–16 (NKJV)</em></p>

---

## (8–10) Life, Gifts, and Fruit

* Enablement for holy living (Gal 5:16–18, 25)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. […] But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.” (Gal 5:16–18)</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Galatians 5:16–18 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.” (Gal 5:25)</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Galatians 5:25 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Distribution of spiritual gifts (1 Cor 12:4–11)
  * Given “as he wills” for the common good

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. […] But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually as He wills.”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>1 Corinthians 12:4–11 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Production of spiritual fruit (Gal 5:22–24)
  * The most reliable evidence of Spirit-filled life

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law.”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Galatians 5:22–24 (NKJV)</em></p>

# OT: Temporary Empowerment

---

## Pattern Before Pentecost

* In the Old Covenant, God’s Spirit often “comes upon” individuals
  * For a **specific task**
  * For a **limited time**
* Pentecost is a “hinge” in the Spirit’s ministry

---

## Example: Skilled Craftsmanship

* Bezalel (and others) filled with God’s Spirit for craftsmanship
  * Tabernacle design, artistry, teaching skill (Ex 31:1–3; Ex 35:30–35)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: ‘See, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,’”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Exodus 31:1–3 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Takeaway: Spirit empowerment is not only “religious ecstasy”
  * It includes practical gifting for God’s purposes

---

## Example: Leadership and Prophetic Empowering

* Seventy elders share in the Spirit’s empowering for governance (Num 11:16–17, 25)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“So the Lord said to Moses: ‘Gather to Me seventy men of the elders of Israel […] Then I will come down and talk with you there. I will take of the Spirit that is upon you and will put the same upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you may not bear it yourself alone.’” (Num 11:16–17)</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Numbers 11:16–17 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“Then the Lord came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and placed the same upon the seventy elders; and it happened, when the Spirit rested upon them, that they prophesied, although they never did so again.” (Num 11:25)</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Numbers 11:25 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Judges are raised up with Spirit-empowerment for deliverance
  * Othniel (Judg 3:9–10)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“When the children of Israel cried out to the Lord, the Lord raised up a deliverer for the children of Israel, who delivered them: Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother. The Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he judged Israel.”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Judges 3:9–10 (NKJV)</em></p>

  * Gideon (Judg 6:34)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“But the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon; then he blew the trumpet, and the Abiezrites gathered behind him.”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Judges 6:34 (NKJV)</em></p>

  * Jephthah (Judg 11:29)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh, and passed through Mizpah of Gilead; and from Mizpah of Gilead he advanced toward the people of Ammon.”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Judges 11:29 (NKJV)</em></p>

  * Samson (Judg 13–15)

---

# NT: Permanent Indwelling

---

## Temple Shift: From Place to People

* Old Covenant: special locus of God’s presence in tabernacle/temple (Holy of Holies)
  * Glory fills the temple (2 Chr 7:1–3)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“When Solomon had finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the Lord filled the temple. And the priests could not enter the house of the Lord, because the glory of the Lord had filled the Lord’s house.”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>2 Chronicles 7:1–3 (NKJV)</em></p>

  * Ezekiel depicts the glory departing in judgment (Ezek 9:3; 11:23)
* New Covenant: the believer becomes the Spirit’s temple
  * “Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit” (1 Cor 6:19–20)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>1 Corinthians 6:19–20 (NKJV)</em></p>

---

## Acts 1:8 “Timeline”

* Jesus promises power when the Spirit comes (Acts 1:8)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Acts 1:8 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Acts shows an outward expansion of Spirit bestowal
  * Jerusalem/Judea (Acts 2)
  * Samaria (Acts 8)
  * Gentiles (Acts 10–11)
  * Further confirmation (Acts 19)
* The Spirit is given to form one unified church body

---

## Baptism of the Spirit Creates “One Body”

* The baptism of the Holy Spirit is the transition point
  * The Spirit indwells and incorporates believers into Christ
* Key summary text: 1 Cor 12:13
