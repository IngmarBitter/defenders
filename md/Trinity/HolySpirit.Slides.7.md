# Fullness of the Holy Spirit

---

## Indwelling vs Filling

* Distinguishes:
  * **Indwelling**: the Spirit’s presence in every believer
  * **Filling**: being empowered/controlled by the Spirit
* Illustration:
  * “Filled with jealousy” or “filled with rage” ⇒ controlled by it
  * “Filled with the Spirit” ⇒ Spirit-directed life

---

## Natural, Carnal, Spiritual

* Uses Paul’s categories (1 Cor 2:14–3:3)
  * Natural (unregenerate): does not have the Spirit
  * Carnal (regenerate but flesh-dominated): immature and ineffective
  * Spiritual (regenerate and Spirit-empowered): discernment and fruit
* Works can be tested: gold vs wood/hay/straw (1 Cor 3:11–15)

---

## Gifts Are Not the Proof

* Corinth had many charismatic gifts, yet was deeply carnal
  * Therefore gifts ≠ reliable sign of fullness
* Emphasizes: the key evidence is **fruit**
  * Gal 5:22–24 (love, joy, peace, etc.)

## Why Many Christians Aren’t Filled

* Two main causes
    1. Lack of total commitment
      * “Cares of the world… delight in riches… desire for other things” (Mark 4)
      * Contrast: “Seek first the kingdom…” (Mt 6:33)
      * Prescription: present yourself as a living sacrifice (Rom 12:1–2)
    2. Reliance on self-effort
      * The Christian life cannot be lived by the flesh
      * “Apart from me you can do nothing” (Jn 15:4–5)
