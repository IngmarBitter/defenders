# Fullness of the Holy Spirit

---

## Indwelling vs Filling

* Distinguish:
  * **Indwelling**: the Spirit's presence in every believer
  * **Filling**: being empowered/controlled by the Spirit
* Illustration:
  * "Filled with jealousy" or "filled with rage" ⇒ controlled by it
  * "Filled with the Spirit" ⇒ Spirit-directed life

## The Command to Be Filled

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissipation; but **be filled with the Spirit**, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord, giving thanks always for all things to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Ephesians 5:18–20 (NKJV)</em></p>

* "Be filled" is a **command** — not optional for mature believers
* Greek present tense: "be being filled" — continuous, not once-for-all
* Contrast: wine controls you negatively; the Spirit controls you positively
* Results: worship, thanksgiving, mutual edification

## Natural, Carnal, Spiritual

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"But the **natural** man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. […] And I, **brethren**, could not speak to you as to **spiritual** people but as to **carnal**, as to babes in Christ."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>1 Corinthians 2:14, 3:1 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Paul's categories:
  * **Natural** (unregenerate): does not receive the things of the Spirit
  * **Carnal** (regenerate but flesh-dominated): immature, "babes in Christ"
  * **Spiritual** (regenerate and Spirit-empowered): discernment and fruit

---

## Gifts Are Not the Proof

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"you were enriched in everything by Him […] so that you **come short in no gift** […] And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual people but as to carnal, as to babes in Christ. […] for **you are still carnal**. For where there are envy, strife, and divisions among you, are you not carnal and behaving like mere men?"</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>1 Corinthians 1:5, 7, 3:1, 3 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Corinth lacked **no gift** — yet Paul calls them **carnal**, not spiritual
* Gifts ≠ reliable sign of Spirit-fullness
* **JWs/Pentecostals:** Both point to visible signs (organizational loyalty / tongues) as proof
* **Reality:** The true evidence is **fruit**, not gifts

---

## The True Evidence: Fruit

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Galatians 5:22–23 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Character transformation, not spectacular displays, marks Spirit-fullness
* Fruit grows gradually through abiding in Christ
* **Illogical:** If gifts proved fullness, Corinth would be the model church — yet Paul rebukes them as immature

---

## Walking in the Spirit

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Galatians 5:16–17 (NKJV)</em></p>

* "Walk" — daily, step-by-step dependence on the Spirit
* Flesh and Spirit are in constant opposition
* Victory comes not by suppressing flesh, but by yielding to the Spirit
* The Spirit-filled life is a moment-by-moment walk, not a one-time event

---

## Grieving and Quenching the Spirit

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Ephesians 4:30 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"Do not quench the Spirit."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>1 Thessalonians 5:19 (NKJV)</em></p>

* **Grieve** — sin saddens the Spirit (relational language — He is a Person!)
* **Quench** — resisting or suppressing the Spirit's promptings
* Both assume believers can hinder the Spirit's work in their lives
* Fullness is lost through unconfessed sin and resistance to God's leading

---

## Repeated Fillings

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, 'Rulers of the people and elders of Israel…' […] And when they had prayed, the place where they were assembled together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Acts 4:8, 31 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Peter was filled at Pentecost (Acts 2:4), then filled **again** here
* The same believers were filled multiple times
* Filling can be lost and **renewed** — unlike indwelling, which is permanent
* Hope: even if we've grieved or quenched the Spirit, fresh filling is available

## Why Many Christians Aren't Filled (1)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"and the cares of this world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Mark 4:19 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Matthew 6:33 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Worldly cares and desires choke out spiritual fruitfulness
* Prescription: present yourself as a living sacrifice (Romans 12:1–2)
* **Cause 1: Lack of total commitment**
  * What does that mean and not mean?

---

## Why Many Christians Aren't Filled (2)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me. I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>John 15:4–5 (NKJV)</em></p>

* A branch cannot bear fruit apart from the vine
* The Christian life cannot be lived by the flesh
* **Cause 2: Reliance on self-effort**
  * What does that mean and not mean?

---

## Summary: Fullness of the Holy Spirit

* **Filling ≠ Indwelling** — indwelling is permanent; filling is ongoing empowerment
* **Commanded:** "Be filled with the Spirit" (Ephesians 5:18) — present tense, continuous
* **Evidence:** Fruit of the Spirit, not spectacular gifts
* **Daily walk:** Moment-by-moment dependence, not a one-time experience
* **Can be lost:** Through grieving (sin) and quenching (resistance)
* **Can be renewed:** Peter and others were filled repeatedly
* **Two obstacles:** 1) Lack of total commitment; 2) Reliance on self-effort
* **Hope:** Fresh filling is always available to those who yield to the Spirit
