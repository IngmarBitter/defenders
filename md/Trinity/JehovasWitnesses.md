# Jehovah's Witnesses: Beliefs Compared with Evangelical Christianity

## Beliefs Shared with Evangelical Christians

1. **The Bible as God's Word** - Both affirm the Bible as the inspired Word of God and the ultimate authority for faith and practice (though JWs use their own New World Translation as their primary Bible translation, and only secondarily refer to others like the KJV)
2. **One True God** - Both believe in monotheism—that there is only one true God
3. **Jesus Christ's Role in Salvation** - Both believe that faith in Jesus Christ is essential for salvation
4. **The Second Coming of Christ** - Both believe Jesus will return
5. **The Resurrection** - Both believe in a future resurrection
6. **Moral Living** - Both emphasize living according to biblical moral standards, including honesty, sexual purity, and avoiding idolatry
7. **The Reality of Satan** - Both believe Satan is a real spiritual being who opposes God
8. **Evangelism** - Both believe in the importance of sharing their faith with others

## Beliefs Contrary to Evangelical Christianity

1. **The Trinity** - JWs deny the Trinity and hold a *Unitarian* view in which only Jehovah (the Father) is truly God; Jesus is a created being (identified with Michael the Archangel), and the Holy Spirit is God's impersonal active force, not a divine Person.
2. **The Deity of Christ** - JWs deny that Jesus is God in the full, eternal sense. They translate John 1:1 as "the Word was a god" and see Jesus as a lesser, created "godlike" being, not as God the Son of the same essence as the Father.
3. **The Holy Spirit** - JWs believe the Holy Spirit is God's active force, not a Person of the Godhead
4. **Hell and Eternal Punishment** - JWs deny the existence of hell as a place of eternal conscious punishment. They believe the wicked are annihilated (cease to exist)
5. **The Soul** - JWs believe humans do not have an immortal soul; at death, a person ceases to exist until the resurrection
6. **Salvation by Works** - While affirming faith in Christ, JWs teach that salvation also requires active participation in the organization's work, including door-to-door witnessing
7. **The 144,000** - JWs teach that only 144,000 people will go to heaven to rule with Christ; the rest of the saved will live forever on a paradise earth
8. **Blood Transfusions** - JWs prohibit blood transfusions based on their interpretation of biblical passages about blood
9. **Celebrating Holidays** - JWs refuse to celebrate Christmas, Easter, birthdays, and other holidays, viewing them as pagan in origin
10. **The Cross** - JWs believe Jesus died on an upright stake, not a cross, and reject the cross as a symbol
11. **The Name of God** - JWs emphasize the exclusive use of "Jehovah" as God's name and believe its use is essential to true worship
12. **Exclusive Organization** - JWs believe their organization (the Watchtower Society) is God's sole channel of truth on earth today

## Detailed Comparison: The Trinity

### 1. The Father

- **What Jehovah's Witnesses Believe**
  - Jehovah alone is the one true God; only the Father is Almighty God.  
  - "Father" is Jehovah's relational title as Creator and God over all.  
  - He directly created his first spirit son (the one who later became Jesus/Michael), and through that son created all other things.  
  - There is no eternal begetting of the Son; the Father/Son relationship is Creator/first-created.

- **What Evangelical Christians Believe**
  - The Father is fully God, one Person of the one triune God (Father, Son, Spirit) who share the same divine essence.  
  - The Father eternally begets the Son; the Son is not created but eternally generated from the Father.  
  - The Father is not God *instead of* the Son and Spirit, but together *with* them as one God.

### 2. The Son (Jesus Christ)

- **What Jehovah's Witnesses Believe**
  - Jesus is Jehovah's first and greatest *created* spirit son, identified with *Michael the Archangel* before and after his earthly life.  
  - As the first created son, he is the agent through whom Jehovah created all other things, but he himself is not eternal or equal with Jehovah.  
  - On earth, Jesus was a perfect human (not God-man); after death, Jehovah recreated/resurrected him as a spirit creature (Michael) again.  
  - He is "a god" in a lesser sense—exalted and godlike, but not Almighty God.  
  - Although they deny his deity, JWs still affirm that Jesus was sinless; they see texts like Romans 3:23 ("all have sinned") as general statements about fallen humanity that exclude Christ as the unique perfect man.

- **What Evangelical Christians Believe**
  - Jesus is the eternal *Son of God*, God the Son, uncreated and of the same essence as the Father and the Spirit.  
  - He is not an angel but the Creator of angels (including Michael); he shares the one divine name and glory of God.  
  - In the incarnation he became fully man while remaining fully God (one Person, two natures, forever).  
  - As "the Son of God," he uniquely bears this title in a personal, eternal sense, not merely as a created "son of God" like angels (cf. Job 1:6; 38:7).  
  - Evangelicals also affirm Jesus' complete sinlessness, but ground it in his divine Person and in the biblical pattern where universal statements about human sin (Rom. 3:23; 5:12) are understood to exclude Christ, who "knew no sin" (2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 4:15; 1 Pet. 2:22).

### 3. The Holy Spirit

- **What Jehovah's Witnesses Believe**
  - The Holy Spirit is not a Person but Jehovah's invisible, impersonal *active force*—like power or energy that God uses to accomplish his will.  
  - The Spirit does not have a will, mind, or self-consciousness distinct from Jehovah; he is not worshiped or prayed to.  

- **What Evangelical Christians Believe**
  - The Holy Spirit is fully God, the third Person of the Trinity—distinct in Person from the Father and the Son, but one in essence with them.  
  - The Spirit has personal attributes (he speaks, teaches, can be grieved, can be lied to) and performs divine works (creation, regeneration, sanctification).  
  - Christians worship the Father, through the Son, in the Holy Spirit, recognizing all three Persons as the one true God.

## Apologetics: How Each Side Defends Its View

### 1. Overall Approach to Scripture

- **Jehovah's Witnesses**
  - Emphasize God's oneness texts (for example Deut 6:4) and read them as ruling out any plurality of persons in God.  
  - Use the New World Translation to support their theology (for example John 1:1 "the Word was a god").  
  - Interpret Father, Son, and Spirit language in strictly hierarchical and functional terms: Jehovah as the only true God; Jesus as created agent; Spirit as impersonal force.

- **Evangelical Christians**
  - Affirm the same monotheistic texts, but also stress passages where Father, Son, and Spirit are each treated as personal and fully divine, yet distinguished in relation (for example Matthew 28:19; John 1; Acts 5:3–4).  
  - Use the whole-bible pattern: one God + three divine persons acting, speaking, creating, and saving together.  
  - The Trinity is seen as a doctrine *inferred* from the data of Scripture, then labeled and systematized.

### 2. Key Texts and How They Are Read

Below are a few representative texts and brief comments on how each side typically handles them. For a fuller treatment and verse tables, see *Trinity.Slides.md*.

- **John 1:1–3**
  - *JWs*: translate "the Word was a god"; argue the absence of the article before "God" in Greek implies an indefinite, lesser "godlike" being, subordinate to Jehovah, through whom all other things were made.  
  - *Evangelicals*: see the anarthrous predicate ("and God was the Word") as qualitative, stressing that the Word fully shares the divine nature. The Word is distinct *from* God the Father ("with God") yet *is* God in essence.

- **John 8:58 ("before Abraham was, I am")**
  - *JWs*: usually take this as a claim to pre-existence, not to sharing the divine name of Exodus 3:14. Jesus is older than Abraham as the first created spirit son.  
  - *Evangelicals*: read the "I am" as deliberate echo of God's self-identification (YHWH), supported by the hostile reaction of Jesus' hearers (attempt to stone him), thus as a direct claim to full deity.

- **John 10:30 ("I and the Father are one")**
  - *JWs*: interpret "one" as unity of purpose or agreement, not unity of essence; Father and Son are in harmony, but only Jehovah is Almighty God.  
  - *Evangelicals*: agree there is unity of purpose, but also note the broader Johannine context (for example John 5:18; claims to divine prerogatives) and the reaction of the Jews as evidence that more than mere agreement is in view.

- **Philippians 2:5–11**
  - *JWs*: see Jesus as divesting himself of a high, exalted heavenly position to become human and obedient to Jehovah, then being exalted in response. This does not imply equality of nature with Jehovah.  
  - *Evangelicals*: read "in very nature God" and the refusal to "grasp" equality with God as affirming that the pre-incarnate Christ fully shared the divine nature, and voluntarily humbled himself in the incarnation.

- **Acts 5:3–4**
  - *JWs*: "lying to the Holy Spirit" is lying to God's power or active force, with the phrase "you have not lied to men but to God" referring to Jehovah; the Spirit is not a distinct person.  
  - *Evangelicals*: point out that the Spirit is addressed personally, can be lied to, and is then directly identified with God. This fits the table in *Trinity.Slides.md* where the Spirit shares divine attributes (for example omniscience, omnipresence) and is called God.

- **Matthew 28:19**
  - *JWs*: treat the triadic formula ("in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit") as functional; Jehovah is the only true God, with Jesus and the Spirit as subordinate means through which he works.  
  - *Evangelicals*: emphasize the single "name" shared by three distinct designations, and connect this to other texts that ascribe divine attributes and works to Father, Son, and Spirit (as summarized in the attributes table in *Trinity.Slides.md*).

### 3. Attribute Arguments (Linked to the Trinity Slides Table)

- **Jehovah's Witnesses**
  - Attribute texts (for example omniscience, omnipresence) are often applied primarily to Jehovah as Father.  
  - Where similar language is used of Jesus, they are read as relative (for example derived authority, limited knowledge) or as applying only after resurrection.  
  - The Holy Spirit verses are taken as poetic or metaphorical references to God's power, not to a distinct divine person.

- **Evangelical Christians**
  - Follow the kind of structure in the *Trinity.Slides.md* table: for each attribute (personhood, unity, divinity, omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, eternity, immutability, creator, roles in salvation), show that Scripture ascribes it to the Father, to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.  
  - Argue that the most natural way to honor all of these texts is to affirm one God in three distinct, co-equal, co-eternal persons, rather than to downgrade the Son to a creature or the Spirit to an impersonal force.

### 4. Trinity Attributes Table (Evangelical Reading vs JW Reading)

The following table summarizes how evangelicals see Scripture attributing the same divine properties to the one God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (drawn from *Trinity.Slides.md*). JWs typically affirm the *Father* column as uniquely and fully true of Jehovah, see many *Son* texts as referring to a lesser, created being, and treat *Spirit* texts as metaphorical for God's power rather than a distinct person.
