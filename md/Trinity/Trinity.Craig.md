Introduction

We’ve just finished a very long excursus on natural theology – looking at arguments for and against the existence of God. Before we begin our next section, let’s step back and reconnoiter.

Our excursus on natural theology is a subsection of a larger unit that we’ve been covering on the Doctrine of God. The first subsection of the Doctrine of God that we looked at was the attributes of God, in which we discussed God’s nature. Then we temporarily took this excursus on natural theology to look at arguments for God’s existence and against it. Now we want to come to the second subsection of the Doctrine of God, and this is on the doctrine of the Trinity.

If I were to ask you here this morning, “How many of you think that God is a person?” probably a number of you would say, “Yes.” Well, technically it is incorrect to say that God is a person. Rather, God is three persons. This is the Christian doctrine of the Trinity. God is personal, yes, but he is not “a” person. This is what serves to distinguish Christianity from other monotheistic faiths like Judaism or Islam which also agree that there is one God who is personal, but they think there is only one person who is God. This also serves to distinguish Christianity from various Christian cults and sects like Jehovah’s Witnesses. You will find inevitably that these sectarian groups get the doctrine of the Trinity wrong – it is almost like a thermometer that you can use to test these different groups to see whether or not they adhere to biblical Christianity.

Unfortunately, the average Christian has little understanding of the doctrine of the Trinity. If he gets into a conversation with a Jehovah’s Witness who comes to his door, I’m afraid that the average Christian will be completely overwhelmed and unable to defend his Trinitarian faith. In fact, if you probe deeply, he probably turns out to be a heretic in the view of the Trinity that he actually espouses. So it is important, I think, that we discuss the doctrine of the Trinity to make sure we accurately understand it.

The doctrine of the Trinity is often obscured by Christians in mystery. Sometimes they will say that the doctrine of the Trinity is logically inconsistent or it is an affront to reason and something that can be held only by faith. It is a mystery. But I think this really does the doctrine a disservice. The fundamental doctrine of the Trinity is not even apparently logically contradictory. The doctrine of the Trinity is not the self-contradictory doctrine that three Gods are somehow one God, or that three persons are somehow one person. Rather, the doctrine states that there are three persons in the one God. Another way to put it: God is tri-personal.

Often Christians will offer inadequate analogies of the Trinity in order to explicate this doctrine. For example, we are sometimes told that the doctrine of the Trinity is like one man who is a son, a husband, and a father. Unfortunately, that is not an accurate analogy for the Trinity because in that case you have only one person who is simply playing three roles or has three relationships. Another analogy that is often used is that water can be liquid, steam, or ice. Yet it is all H2O. This is perhaps a better analogy because at least here you have one substance – one essence (H2O) – that could be in the form of a liquid or of steam or of ice. But again the analogy really fails because the water is only successively in those various states. It can be first liquid, and then if it freezes, it turns to ice, or if you boil it, it turns to steam. But it is not simultaneous. It is a succession of states in the water.

I think it is better just to avoid these sorts of analogies. They are all, I think, going to be inadequate in the end. It is better to simply say that just as I am a being with one center of self-consciousness whom I call “I”, God is a being who has three centers of self-consciousness, each of which can say “I”. Each one has a first-person perspective: In the same way that I can say, I am William Craig, the persons of the Trinity can say respectively, I am the Father. I am the Son. I am the Holy Spirit. So God is a tri-personal being. He is a being with three centers of self-consciousness in contrast to human persons who are each one being with one center of self-consciousness.

The doctrine of the Trinity is a systematic summary of the data of Scripture. Therefore, it doesn’t really matter that the word “Trinity” is not found in the Bible. The important thing is not the word, but rather the concept or the data that this word denominates. Any word could be used to denominate this doctrine so long as the scriptural data are respected and not twisted or bruised in any way. The significant thing is not the word “Trinity.” The significant thing will be the concepts that the Trinity embodies, namely that God is a single tri-personal being.

With that, we have introduced the subject that we will be discussing over the next several weeks. I think at this point it would be a good time to simply bring today's lesson to a close. What we will talk about next time will be the scriptural data that undergird the doctrine of the Trinity. We will see that the Scriptures teach both that there is one God and one God alone, but also that there are three distinct persons in the Godhead.

§ 5. Doctrine of God: Trinity
The Biblical Data

We've just introduced the subject of the Trinity. Last time I indicated that although the word “Trinity” is not found in the Scriptures, that is really incidental. The point is that the doctrine of the Trinity is a systematic summary of the biblical data that indicate two things: that there is one God and that there are three distinct persons in the Godhead. If those facts are true then the doctrine of the Trinity is true. Let's look at the scriptural data that support these two truths.

B.  Scriptural Data

                  1.  There is one God                          

First, that there is one God. Both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament we find that this doctrine – monotheism--is taught; there is but one God.

a.  Old Testament:

Turn to Deuteronomy 6:4: “Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD” This is the fundamental confession of Judaism – the so-called shema. The first clause of that confession is the uniqueness of God – there is one LORD.

Look at 1 Kings 8:60 – this is Solomon’s benediction on the occasion of the dedication of the temple. He prays “that all the peoples of the earth may know that the LORD is God; there is no other.” So there is no other God than the LORD – the God of Israel.

Also Isaiah 45:5a, 18:

I am the LORD, and there is no other, besides me there is no God. . . . For thus says the LORD, who created the heavens (he is God!), who formed the earth and made it (he established it; he did not create it a chaos, he formed it to be inhabited!): ‘I am the LORD, and there is no other.’

So the God of Israel is the only God that there is. There is no other God.

In Isaiah 44, you find a lengthy satirical critique of the pagan deities of Israel's neighbors: how the idolater carves a piece of wood, paints it, decorates it, clothes it, and then falls down in front of his own creation and says, Thou art my God, and worships the products of his own hands. Isaiah just laughs at this – makes fun of it, at its folly. Israel did not consider itself to have simply a special God – one of the many gods, Israel's God. No, Israel's God was the only God that there is. There is no other God besides Yahweh,

the LORD.

b.  New Testament:

In the New Testament, the Christian followers of Jesus taught and believed the same thing – there is only one God. Look, for example, at Mark 12:29. Jesus is asked what is the greatest commandment and “Jesus answered, ‘The first is, “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.”’” He here quotes the shema as the fundamental commandment and confession of Israel and affirms Jewish monotheism.

Similarly, in Romans 3:29-30a, Paul also affirms monotheism. Paul says, “Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also, since God is one.” So, again, Paul did not conceive the Jewish God to be just one of many. He says the God of Israel is, in fact, also the God of Gentiles because there is only one God, and therefore Jew and Gentile alike can be united in the worship of the one true God.

In 1 Corinthians 8:4, addressing the subject of pagan idolatry, Paul says, “As to the eating of food offered to idols, we know that an idol has no real existence, and that there is no God but one.” So these idol gods are not real gods. They are figments of the imagination. In fact, he says, there is no God but one – the God of Israel.

1 Timothy 2:5 says: “For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.” Again, Paul affirms the uniqueness of God - there is one God and one mediator between God and man.

Finally, in James 2:19, James says, “You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe – and shudder!” So even the demonic forces are monotheists – even the demons believe that there is one true God, and they tremble because they stand under God's wrath and condemnation.

So, to state the obvious, it is clear that the Bible teaches there is but one God, and the Old and New Testaments concur that this is the God of Israel.

2.  There are three distinct persons in the Godhead

                 

In addition to that, the next point is that the Scriptures teach that there are three distinct persons in the Godhead. Let's look at each of the three persons – the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

a.  The Father

First, God the Father. Two points are to be made here.

(1)  Is a distinct person

First, the Scriptures teach that God the Father is a distinct person. Let's look at several passages that indicate that.

First, Matthew 11:27. Jesus says, “All things have been delivered to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.” Clearly in this passage Jesus differentiates himself as the Son from the Father. The Father and the Son stand in relationship to each other – they know each other and the Son reveals the Father. So clearly the Father is a distinct person from the Son, who knows the Son, is known by the Son, and is revealed by the Son.

Also, Matthew 26:39. This is the account of Jesus' prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane just prior to his arrest and trial. It says, “And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, ‘My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.’” Here Jesus prays to the Father and asks that he might be spared this terrible suffering. But then he submits his will to the will of the Father and says, Not as I will, but as thou wilt. Again, showing the distinction of the Father and the Son and the submission of the Son to the Father's will.

Next, John 14:16-17. We've seen that the Father and the Son are distinct persons. Now in John 14:16-17 we see the Father's distinction from the Spirit. Jesus says,

And I will pray the Father, and he will give you another Counselor, to be with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him; you know him, for he dwells with you, and will be in you.

Here we have all three persons of the Godhead. The Son is praying to the Father to send another Advocate – another Counselor – and that will be the Spirit. We have three distinct persons here. The Father is distinct from both the Son and from the Spirit.

(2)  Is God

The second point is that not only is the Father a distinct person, but the Father is God. Again, this is to state the obvious. Look at Psalm 89:26: “He shall cry to me, ‘Thou art my Father, my God, and the Rock of my salvation.’” So one of the metaphors under which Israel conceived of the Lord (Israel's God) is as a heavenly Father. God is the Father of the children of Israel.

One finds this conception of God as Father elsewhere in the Old Testament. For example, Isaiah 63:16: “For thou art our Father, though Abraham does not know us, and Israel does not acknowledge us; thou, O LORD, art our Father, our Redeemer from of old is thy name.” Here Isaiah says even if Abraham doesn’t acknowledge us (and Abraham was regarded as the father of the Jewish nation), even if Israel or Jacob doesn’t acknowledge us as his progeny, nevertheless the LORD is our Father. God is the Father of Israel.

In the New Testament, of course, this is the way in which Jesus presents the God of the Old Testament to his disciples and to the people whom he taught. Matthew 6:9. This is the Lord’s prayer. He says, “Pray then like this, ‘Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.” Jesus taught his disciples to pray to God as their heavenly Father and to regard God as their Father.

So the Scriptures teach that God the Father is distinct from the Son and from the Spirit, and that the Father is God. He is the God of the Old Testament. In fact, this word “God” in the Greek, ho theos (literally meaning “the God” – the article ho is the masculine definite article) in the New Testament usually refers to God the Father. When the authors of the New Testament say something about God (ho theos) they are usually talking about the Father.

For example, Paul’s customary greeting in his letters was to say something like this: “Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ.” So the Father is spoken of as God – God the Father.

Compare what Paul says in Galatians 4:4-6:

But when the time had fully come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons. And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, ‘Abba! Father!’

Here, again, all three persons of the Godhead are mentioned. When it says “God” sent forth his Son, “God” sent the Spirit, it means God the Father. This is clear because the Spirit teaches us to cry out to God, “Abba! Father!” So “God” in the New Testament typically refers to the person of the Father. It says the Father sends the Son (who is Jesus), and then he also sends the Spirit of his Son into our hearts whereby we cry “Abba! Father!”

It is very interesting to read the New Testament in this light. When you read something about God, it is typically talking about God the Father.

So the first point is the Father is a distinct person, and the Father is God.

b.  The Son

Let’s go to the second point concerning the Son (or Jesus Christ). Again, the Scriptures indicate both that the Son is a distinct person and also that the Son is God.

(1)  Is a distinct person

First, let’s look at some verses that indicate that the Son is a distinct person from the Father. Mark 1:9-11. This is the baptism scene of Jesus. Mark says,

In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens opened and the Spirit descending upon him like a dove; and a voice came from heaven, ‘Thou art my beloved Son; with thee I am well pleased.’

Here we have all three persons of the Godhead mentioned. The Son undergoes baptism by John the Baptist, the Spirit descends upon him, and then the Father from heaven says, “Thou art my beloved Son; with thee I am well pleased.” So the Son is clearly distinct from both the Spirit and the Father in this passage.

John 17:1-5. This is Jesus’ great intercessory prayer for the church:

When Jesus had spoken these words, he lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, ‘Father, the hour has come; glorify thy Son that the Son may glorify thee, since thou hast given him power over all flesh, to give eternal life to all whom thou hast given him. And this is eternal life, that they know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent. I glorified thee on earth, having accomplished the work which thou gavest me to do; and now, Father, glorify thou me in thy own presence with the glory which I had with thee before the world was made.’

Clearly here Jesus is praying to another person. He is not talking to himself. He is praying to the Father and asking that the Father would glorify himself in the Son and speaking of how the Son has glorified the Father while on this planet. We have here a clear distinction between the Father and the Son. The sixteenth and seventeenth chapters in John clearly speak of the three persons of the Godhead. If you want to read these passages on your own, you will find over and over again the distinction between the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.

Let’s look at John 7:39 for the distinction from the Holy Spirit. Here Jesus quotes the Scripture, “He who believes in me, out of his heart shall flow rivers of living water,” and then John says, “Now this he said about the Spirit, which those who believed in him were to receive, for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.” So the distinction between the Spirit and the Son is clearly drawn here because the Son was with them but the Spirit was not. The Spirit was someone they would receive in the future after Jesus had departed from them and been glorified. So although the Son was present with them, the Spirit was not yet present with them in the way that he would be in his fullness. The Spirit and the Son are distinguished from each other personally.

Finally, John 16:7, Jesus says, “Nevertheless I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Counselor will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.” Here Jesus is speaking of that other Counselor or Advocate that the Father would send. Again, he distinguishes this person from himself: So long as I am here with you, the Counselor will not come; but when I go, then the Counselor (the Spirit of truth) will be sent to be with you and be in you. So Jesus distinguishes himself from the Spirit of God who would come after him.

So in the New Testament we have the Son as a distinct person from the Father and from the Holy Spirit.

(2)  Is God

Secondly, this person is also God. The Son is God. Immediately this raises a problem. If ho theos refers to the Father, then how can you say that Jesus is God without implying that he is the Father, which the New Testament writers did not want to do? They did not believe that the Father had become incarnate and died on the cross! Or that somehow the Father is no longer in heaven. So how could the New Testament writers affirm the deity of Christ without saying or implying that he is the Father? What you find is that the New Testament authors wrangled every way that they could to assert the deity of Christ without saying flatly that he is God.

A very good popular level book on this is by Michael Green, The Truth of God Incarnate. Green does an excellent job of showing the extent to which New Testament writers went to affirm in some very creative ways the deity of Christ without saying that Jesus is ho theos, which would imply that he is the Father. That is precisely why you do not find these sort of flat statements in the New Testament, “Jesus is God,” because to say “Jesus is ho theos” would be understood to say that Jesus is the Father, and this is not what the New Testament writers wanted to say. So they find every other way conceivable to express the deity of Christ without coming right out and saying flatly that Jesus is ho theos. Let’s look at some of these ways in which the deity of Christ is affirmed by New Testament authors. 

Kyrios
The early Christians’ solution to this problem was startling and ingenious. They adopted the term kyrios (“Lord”) as their principal means of referring to Christ (368 times in the NT). The significance of this term lies in the fact that while it, like the English word “lord,” has a wide range of meaning, kyrios is the term Greek-speaking Jews substituted for God’s proper name “Yahweh” in the OT! Jews would not pronounce aloud the divine name Yahweh but substituted kyrios for it.  So Lord or kyrios translates the name of God in the Old Testament – Yahweh. The New Testament writers call Jesus “Lord” (kyrios) and then they apply to him Old Testament passages about Yahweh! So while not referring to Jesus as ho theos (which would suggest that he is the Father), they do refer to Jesus as kyrios (Lord) and apply to him Old Testament passages about Yahweh.

Look, for example, at Romans 10:9, 13. Paul says, “If you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord [kyrios] and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.” Here is the fundamental confession of the New Testament church – Jesus is Lord. Jesus is kyrios. Then in verse 13 the prooftext is given from the Old Testament. Quoting from Joel 2:32: “For ‘everyone who calls upon the name of the LORD [Yahweh] will be saved.’” Christians took this Old Testament passage about Yahweh – the God of the Old Testament – and applied it to Jesus and said everyone who confesses that Jesus is Lord will be saved.

This was the most important confession in the New Testament church. Look at 1 Corinthians 12:3 – “I want you to understand that no one speaking by the Spirit of God ever says ‘Jesus be cursed!’ and no one can say ‘Jesus is Lord [kyrios]’ except by the Holy Spirit.”

Also look at 1 Corinthians 16:22 where Paul says, “Our Lord, come!” The Greek term there is maranatha – it is a transliteration into Greek of the Aramaic phrase “marana tha” which means, “Our Lord, come!” This is the language of the New Testament church at prayer. It goes right back to the Aramaic that the early followers of Jesus spoke in Jerusalem. And they prayed to Jesus as Lord, praying “Our Lord, come!” So you have here the original language of the Jerusalem fellowship praying to Jesus as Lord – the name of God in the Old Testament.

I think you can see how naïve it is when somebody says the New Testament doesn’t say that Jesus is ho theos or is God. What it does say is Jesus is kyrios, which is the Lord – Yahweh – in the Old Testament.

One last passage that I want to share with you, and this is 1 Corinthians 8:6. This differentiation between ho theos and kyrios leads to some really strange circumlocutions in the New Testament. Look at 1 Corinthians 8:6. “For us, there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.” Here Paul adapts the Shema “the Lord our God is one,” but the Lord and God are differentiated. There is one God, the Father, but one Lord, Jesus Christ, and then they are both described in virtually identical terms. They are the ones through whom everything exists, the ground of all being. They are the Lord God, but they are different persons. One is called the Father, the other is kyrios.

As equally startling as the application of OT proof texts about Yahweh to Jesus Christ is the NT authors’ unsettling practice of retrojecting Jesus into OT narratives about Yahweh. We have a prime example in Jn 12.41. Speaking of Isaiah’s vision of the Lord high and lifted up in the temple, John applies this passage to Jesus: “Isaiah said this because he saw his glory and spoke of him.” According to John, the vision of the Lord of hosts described in Is 6.1 was in actuality a vision of the pre-incarnate Christ! We have here not merely the application of an OT proof text about Yahweh to Jesus, but rather the actual retrojection of Christ into a prior historical circumstance. He is here clearly equated with God.

A second stunning example of this is in Jude 5. Referring to the Lord’s judgment upon the people of Egypt in leading Israel out of bondage, Jude says, “Now I desire to remind you, though you are fully informed, once and for all, that Jesus, who saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe.” Older translations of Jude have the word, “Lord” instead of “Jesus.” But the best Greek manuscripts, which are the basis for contemporary translations, read that Jesus saved a people out of the land of Egypt! This is absolutely astounding. Jude says the Lord who led the people out of Egypt and judged the Egyptians was actually Jesus. This has to be one of the most powerful proof texts for the deity of Christ in the New Testament.

So chew on that during the week until we meet next time and talk about other creative ways in which the New Testament authors affirm Christ’s deity.[1]

 (2) Jesus as God in the New Testament

Last time we saw that the biblical writers confronted the difficulty of saying that Jesus is God but without implying that Jesus is the Father. This is problematic because, as I shared, the word for God in the Greek – ho theos (ho is the definite article “the” so “the God” literally) – typically refers to the Father. The New Testament Christians, while believing that Jesus was deity (was divine) did not think that he was the Father. That is why you don’t find many statements in the New Testament that Jesus is ho theos – that Jesus is God. That would be to say Jesus is the Father. Instead, as we saw, they picked a different term to characterize Jesus, and that was the term kyrios or Lord. Kyrios is the Greek word that translates the name of God in the Old Testament – Yahweh. The early Christians, as we saw, would call Jesus “Lord” and they would apply to him Old Testament passages about Yahweh saying that these are in reference to Christ and retroject Christ into Old Testament narratives about Yahweh. We find in the New Testament that the writers attempted to do everything they could to affirm the deity of Christ but without saying that he was the Father.

The second point that illustrates this is the fact that Christ is given the role of God. To Christ these authors ascribed roles that are normally reserved for God, such as being the Creator.

For example, let’s look again at Colossians 1 beginning with verse 15 and following.

He is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of all creation; for in him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or authorities—all things were created through him and for him.

Here the role of being the Creator of all reality other than God is ascribed to Christ.

Similarly, in John 1:1-3 we have the same teaching.

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God; all things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made.

Here, again, you have ascribed to Christ, the Word of God, the creation of all reality apart from God himself.

Finally, look at Hebrews 1:1-3a where you have the same teaching:

In many and various ways God spoke of old to our fathers by the prophets; but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world. He reflects the glory of God and bears the very stamp of his nature, upholding the universe by his word of power.

Here, just like Paul in Colossians 1 and John in John 1, Christ is said to be the creator of the world, he is the heir of all things just as Paul says he is the first-born of all creation, he reflects the glory of God and bears the very stamp of his nature. The idea there is like a signet ring which is pressed into hot wax to seal a document or a letter. Just as that wax bears the imprint of the ring, so Christ bears the very stamp or imprint of the divine nature. He upholds the universe by his word of power, just as John says all things were created through him.

So the fact that we have in Colossians 1, Hebrews 1, and John 1 this same teaching about the cosmic Christ as the Creator and Sustainer of all things apart from God shows that this was the widespread conviction of the early church. This is not a doctrine taught by some idiosyncratic author. These are three different authors – Paul, an anonymous author of Hebrews, and then John of the Gospel of John. All of them teach the same thing with respect to Christ – that he is the Creator of the world. He plays the role of God in being the source of all reality apart from God.

Third, full deity is ascribed to Christ. Look at Colossians 1:15-19 and then also 2:9. By way of background to the letter of Colossians, Paul is faced here with a sort of incipient Gnosticism in Colossae. Gnostics held that the realm of the spiritual is good and the realm of the material is evil. Therefore, God, being fully good, cannot have any sort of concourse or relationship with the material world because that would taint him with evil. So Gnostics developed this system whereby God in his fullness and purity is utterly diverse and detached from the world. But there emerged from God in a sort of descending stairstep fashion quasi-divine beings that increasingly mediate between God and the material world, a kind of increasing materialization as you descend these stairs. What Paul says in Colossians 1:15-19 and 2:9 is that this linkage between God and the world is utterly misconceived. Paul says that the whole fullness of deity – that pure God substance – dwells in Christ in the flesh, in bodily form. Let’s read Colossians 1:15-19. He says of Christ:

He is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of all creation, for in him all things were created in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or authorities – all things were created through him and for him. He is before all things, and in him all things hold together. He is the head of the body, the church; He is the beginning, the first-born from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent. For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell.

Here Paul says this fullness of the Godhead dwells in Jesus Christ. Then in 2:9 he says even more clearly, “For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily.” That is so un-Gnostic! The fullness of deity dwells bodily in Christ. This is a statement of the deity of Christ which is, I think, one of the strongest in the New Testament. Jesus Christ is literally God incarnate. He is the fullness of deity dwelling bodily in this world.

Fourth,  Finally, sometimes the authors in the New Testament simply lose all restraint, and they come right out and say, yes, Jesus Christ is ho theos – Jesus is God. Not that they were completely unguarded in their assertions: in any context in which Christ is referred to as theos there is almost always some personal differentiation between the Father and Christ, lest Christ be confused with the Father. Their personal distinction remains inviolate. Nonetheless, on several occasions the NT does affirm that Jesus Christ is God.

The majority of NT scholars hold that theos is applied to Jesus no more than nine but no fewer than five times in the NT. These remarkable texts have been meticulously examined and ranked by Murray Harris in his book Jesus as God. I shall briefly examine these texts in what I consider to be an ascending order of confidence in their referring to Christ as (ho) theos, climaxing with the decisive texts of the Johannine corpus. I shall present the NRSV translation.

Rom 9.5

to them belong the patriarchs, and from them, according to the flesh, comes the Messiah, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen.

The key interpretive question regarding this statement concerns its punctuation. Should there be one sentence or two? Translations differ. If it is two sentences, the second sentence begins after the word “Messiah”: God, who is over all be blessed forever.

The basic difficulty with taking “who is” to begin a new sentence is that such an understanding separates “who is” from its natural antecedent “the messiah”. Harris judges that to divorce “who is” from the grammatical antecedent “the messiah” is “unconscionable.”[1]

Moreover, a major problem with the two sentence view is that whenever “blessed” occurs in an independent doxology, it always precedes God’s name (II Cor 1.3; Eph 1.3; I Pet 1.3). Normal biblical word order for independent doxologies would require here something like “Blessed be God”. Word order thus makes it quite improbable that Rom 9.5 contains an independent doxology to God the Father.

Harris reports that of the 56 principal commentators consulted for his study, only 13 take theos to refer to God the Father, while 36 see a reference to Christ, a reading that is captured by the punctuation of the Greek text adopted in the 26th edition of the Nestle-Aland text and the third edition of the United Bible Society text, in a significant reversal of their previous positions.[2]

Accordingly, in Rom 9.5 Christ is very probably said to be God. The designation of Christ as God cannot plausibly be construed as some weak sense of divinity, because Christ is said in this very passage to be “over all things.” So in calling Christ theos, Paul is either identifying Christ with God the Father or ascribing to Christ the same divine status held by the Father. Since Paul obviously distinguished between Christ and the Father, he must be placing Christ and the Father on the same plane but without sacrificing his Jewish monotheism. So here Christ is held to be God, just as the Father is God.

Heb 1.8

In the opening chapter of Hebrews we read that God says to the Son,

Your throne, O God, is forever and ever

The principal question to be settled here is whether ho theos should be understood as a vocative form of address (“Your throne, O God, is forever and ever”) or as a nominative subject (“God is your throne forever and ever”). Since either is grammatically possible, considerations of background and context must guide our determination of meaning.

In terms of background, the author is citing LXX Ps 44.7 (= Ps 45.7): “your throne, O God, is forever and ever,” so that either the king or God Himself is addressed. The whole point of the opening section of Hebrews is to show the Son’s superiority to the angels. In order to show the Son’s superiority to any angelic being the Son is addressed in vv8, 10 as both “God” and “Lord,” twin titles for deity:

“Your throne, O God, is forever and ever” (v8)

“In the beginning, Lord, you founded the earth” (v10).

Calling Christ both “God” and “Lord” in contrast to angels thus supports the theological point that the author is making.

There is no denying the Christological import of this passage. The parallelism of the Son’s being addressed as both “God” and “Lord” and the exalted descriptions of him in his superiority to angelic beings make it clear that Christ is not addressed merely in the way that a Jewish king might be called elohim. God is said to have created the world through the Son and made him heir of all things (Heb 1.2). “He reflects the glory of God and bears the very stamp of his nature [hypostasis], upholding the universe by his word of power” (v3). Nothing of this sort could be said of any angelic being.

Tit 2.13

The writer to Titus expresses our hope in Christ’s eschatological appearing with the words,

while we wait for the blessed hope and the manifestation of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.

The main interpretive question about this statement concerns its grammatical construction. Do “God” and “Savior” designate one person (“our great God and Savior”) or two (“the great God and our Savior”)? Fortunately, there is a clear answer to this question. There is broad majority support for understanding the reference to be to a single person, for at least two reasons.

First, it is characteristic of Greek grammar, roughly speaking, that the construction takes a single referent rather than two. This principle was originally formulated by Granville Sharp and so is known as Sharp’s Rule.


Second, the expression “God and Savior” was a stereotyped formula common in first century religious terminology. It invariably denoted one deity, not two.

Harris reports that on the basis of such considerations almost all grammarians and lexicographers, many commentators, and many writers on NT theology or Christology are agreed in the verdict that in Tit 2.13 Jesus Christ is called “our great God and Savior.”[3] More recently Gordon Fee observes that this view is “the currently ‘reigning’ point of view, adopted by almost everyone in the NT academy.”[4]

II Pet 1.1

The same grammatical question that attends Tit 2.13 also attends II Pet 1.1, which speaks of

the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ

The only difference in the construction is that here the possessive pronoun “our” is brought forward rather follows Savior. But the difference in the position of “Our” is trivial.[5] What is critical is that the two substantives are governed by a single definite article. Grammatically, Sharp’s Rule and the use of the standardized formula God and Savior require here as well reference to one person.

Harris reports that the view that in II Pet 1.1 the title “our God and Savior” is applied to Jesus Christ is endorsed by the great majority of 20th-century commentators, by most grammarians, and by authors of general works on Christology or II Peter. Tit 2.13 and II Pet 1.1 are thus mutually reinforcing, confirming the view that by the time these works were written Christ was being referred to as God.

Johannine Writings

Even highly sceptical critics overwhelmingly admit that by the time we get to the Johannine writings, the belief in the full deity of Christ had come to expression in the NT.[6] The Christological bookends of the Gospel of John are the affirmation of Christ’s deity in the Prologue (Jn 1.1) and Thomas’ ringing confession in the narrative of Christ’s resurrection appearance to Thomas and the Twelve (Jn 20.28).

Jn 1.1

 

The Prologue opens with a triadic formula:

In the beginning was the Word,

and the Word was with God,

and the Word was God. (Jn 1.1)

The Prologue reflects the influence of the Logos doctrine of Middle Platonism.[7] So I shall speak henceforth of the Logos. According to v1a the Logos was “in the beginning,” doubtless an echo of LXX Gen 1.1, “In the beginning. . .” (En archē). The statement thus endorses the traditional Logos doctrine that the Logos “pre-existed,” in the sense that the Logos did not begin to exist at the moment of creation or is a creature. As in Middle Platonism, the Logos is the instrumental cause of creation (Jn 1.3). This Logos is said in v1b to have existed with God and so to be in some sense differentiated from God. Nonetheless v1c states that the Logos was God, thus in some sense identifying them. As in Middle Platonism, then, the deity of the Logos is clearly affirmed, while an inner distinction within God is postulated.

 

So the crucial question is, Whom are we talking about here? It is indisputable that John identifies the Logos with the pre-incarnate Christ (Jn 1.14, 17b). The Logos himself entered human history (Jn 1.10-11). The Prologue thus affirms the pre-existence of Jesus Christ, his uncreated being, and his deity.

Jn 1.18

No one has ever seen God. It is God the only Son, who is close to the Father’s heart, who has made him known. (Jn 1.18)

After referring to Jesus as the only begotten of the Father in v14, now John boldly calls him the only begotten God. The presence of “the only begotten God” in both p66 and p75 has convinced most textual critics that here Jesus Christ is called theos.[8] By means of the stunning appellation “the only-begotten God” John differentiates Christ the Son from God the Father while regarding both as God.

 

Although interesting interpretive questions arise concerning the meaning of “only begotten” (monogenēs), their resolution is not germane to our interest in Christ’s deity. The overriding point remains that all of the proposed translations of monogenēs theos refer to Jesus as “God.”

 

Jn 20.28

 

We reach the Christological climax of the Gospel of John in Thomas’ confession to the risen Jesus:

My Lord and my God! (Jn 20.28)

Here we confront no textual issues, no interpretive conundrums, no translation difficulties, just a blunt and straightforward confession. Bringing together the titles “Lord” and “God,” Thomas’ confession of who Jesus truly is constitutes a fitting climax to the entire Gospel. This pairing of kyrios and theos is abundantly attested in the LXX, the closest parallel being LXX Ps 34.23 [35.23]: ho theos mou kai ho kyrios mou, addressed to Yahweh.[9] That Thomas’ confession was not just ecstatic utterance is obvious not only from its OT background but also from the fact that Jesus blesses him for his confession, along with those who believe similarly (v29).

I Jn 5.20

we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding so that we may know him who is true; and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life. (I Jn 5.20)

The question, in Greek as in English, concerns the antecedent of the demonstrative pronoun “this” or “he” (houtos): is it “him who is true” or is it “Jesus Christ”? Either is grammatically possible, and so considerations of context will have to guide our decision. Although Harris esteemed both alternatives to be equally probable, the wide majority of scholars since he wrote have argued that houtos refers to Jesus Christ as God.[10]

Generally, houtos refers back to the most recently mentioned available antecedent, which in this case is Iēsou Christō. Referring to Jesus Christ accords with I Jn 5.5-6: “Who is it that overcomes the world but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? This is he who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ.”

Many commentators have observed that taking houtos to refer to “him that is true” makes the phrase into a tautology (“This True One is the true God”) and functions poorly rhetorically at the letter’s close.[11] But a description of Jesus Christ as the true God is a dramatic closing wholly consonant with Johannine theology and, in light of Jn 1.1, 18; 20.28, almost to be expected. John believed that just as the Father is God, so the Son is God.[12] Whether we can make sense of such a statement is a question for the philosophical, not the biblical, theologian.

Most NT scholars, then, do not agree with Harris’ judgement that in I Jn 5.20 it is equiprobable that houtos refers to God or to Jesus Christ. Indeed, many consider the reference to Jesus Christ to be more than merely probable. The preeminent Johannine commentators Raymond Brown and Rudolf Schnackenburg, for example, conclude respectively, “I think the arguments clearly favor houtos as a reference to Jesus Christ”[13] and “There is no longer any doubt . . . that the following houtos. . . refers to Jesus Christ.”[14]

Together the passages we have examined combine to constitute a powerful case that Jesus Christ is presented as God in the pages of the NT. Christ is declared to be divine, just as the Father is divine. The specification of necessary and sufficient conditions for (full) divinity is thus somewhat beside the point. What matters is that Christ is divine in the same sense that the Father is divine, that they are equally divine.

The last point I want to make with respect to the affirmation of the deity of Christ in the New Testament is that there are many, many other passages which we will not take the time to read in which Christ functions as God. For example, receiving worship. This is unique to God. Only God can properly receive worship. And yet Christ receives worship in the New Testament.

The point is that these New Testament believers thought that Jesus of Nazareth, who had lived among them, who had died, who was raised from the dead by God, and ascended into heaven, that in some difficult to express way he was God himself. Now, he was not the Father. That’s clear. But he was equal to the Father. That is to say, he was God.

## Doctrine of Trinity (Part 4): The Holy Spirit
December 19, 2023

The Holy Spirit

We've been looking at the doctrine of the Trinity. We've seen that the New Testament affirms that the Father is a distinct person from the Spirit and the Son, and that the Father is God. Secondly, we saw that similarly the Scriptures say that Jesus Christ is a distinct person from the Father and the Spirit, and that Jesus Christ is God. Today we want to turn to the third person of the Trinity – the Holy Spirit. Again, we will see that the New Testament affirms both that the Holy Spirit is a distinct person from the Father and the Son, and that the Holy Spirit is likewise God.

First, the Holy Spirit is a distinct person.

Luke 11:13: “If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!” Here the Father is spoken of as distinct from the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is given by the Father to those who ask him.

John 14:26: Jesus says, “But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.” Here all three of the persons are distinguished. There is the Holy Spirit who is given by the Father in the name of the Son. The three persons are mentioned in this single saying as distinct persons.

Turn to John 15:26 – a very interesting verse. Again Jesus is speaking: “When the Counselor comes, whom I shall send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness to me.” Again you have all three of the persons mentioned. There is the Father, the Holy Spirit, and the Son to whom the Holy Spirit will bear witness. What is especially interesting about this verse is that John emphasizes the personhood of the Holy Spirit by using the masculine pronoun for him even though the word “Spirit” (pneuma in the Greek) is neuter. So when he says “the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father” he actually violates Greek grammar. Instead of saying “the Spirit which proceeds from the Father; it will bear witness to me,” he uses the masculine pronoun “he” -  “he will bear witness to me” - in order to underline that we are talking here about a person, not a thing. The Holy Spirit is a person just like the Father and the Son.

Romans 8:26-27. Paul says,

Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with sighs too deep for words. And he who searches the hearts of men knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.

Here Paul describes the intercessory ministry of the Holy Spirit to the Father on our behalf. We don't know what to pray for many times. We have limited wisdom and insight. But the Holy Spirit intercedes with the Father on our behalf, and the Father knows the mind of the Spirit and knows how to answer our prayers because the Spirit intercedes according to God's will. So here you have this very interesting ministry of the Holy Spirit on our behalf in prayer and intercession before the Father, so that he converts, as it were, our prayers into God's will.

Matthew 28:19 is one of the famous trinitarian verses in the New Testament where all three of the persons are mentioned. Jesus says to them, “Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” Here you have a formula for baptism where all three of the persons are mentioned. Converts to Christianity are to be baptized in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

2 Corinthians 13:14 also mentions all three of the persons of the Trinity. A wonderful benediction: “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.” Here you have the grace of Christ, the love of God (that is, the Father), and then the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. So all three of the persons are mentioned in this benediction, just as they are in the baptismal formula.

Finally, 1 Peter 1:1-2 also mentions all three of the trinitarian persons.

Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the exiles of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, chosen and destined by God the Father and sanctified by the Spirit for obedience to Jesus Christ and for sprinkling with his blood, may grace and peace be multiplied to you.

Here you have all three of the persons: God the Father, who has chosen and destined the believers, and the Spirit who sanctifies them for obedience to Jesus Christ.

So we have a number of passages, I think, in which the Holy Spirit is distinguished from both the Father and the Son. He is a distinct person.

Here we also need to make a note about New Testament terminology for the Spirit. We saw that very often the word “God” simply refers to the Father. When it comes to the Holy Spirit, Jesus promised that the Holy Spirit would come in his place and in his name. He would continue to carry out the ministry of Jesus in the absence of Jesus after Jesus had ascended to the Father. Look at John 14:26: “The Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.” Here the Holy Spirit is sent in the name of Christ, and he serves to bring Christ's teaching to recollection on the part of the disciples.

Also look at John 16:13-14: Jesus says,

When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you.

Here we see the subordination of the Holy Spirit in the plan of salvation to the Son. The Holy Spirit doesn't speak on his own authority. We've seen rather he comes in the name of the Son – in the name of Christ – and then he will declare to the disciples the things that he receives – the things concerning Jesus Christ. The role of the Holy Spirit is that of attesting to and continuing the ministry of Jesus, acting in his name and authority, and in his place.

So in the New Testament the Holy Spirit becomes so closely identified with Jesus Christ that he is often spoken of as the Spirit of Christ – not the Spirit of God but the Spirit of Christ, or even sometimes he is simply called Christ. Look, for example, at the very interesting passage in Romans 8:9-11. Here Paul says,

But you are not in the flesh, you are in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Any one who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. But if Christ is in you, although your bodies are dead because of sin, your spirits are alive because of righteousness. If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit which dwells in you.

Did you notice the progression in the terminology here? It goes from “the Spirit of God” to “the Spirit of Christ” to simply “Christ”: If Christ is in you (meaning the Spirit of Christ, that is to say the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit). Here you have the identification of the Spirit so completely with Christ that he is actually referred to as Christ.

So very often today, people will say that, in order to be born again, you need to receive Christ as your Savior and that it is receiving Christ that will produce the new birth and a relationship with God. Technically, it is really the Holy Spirit that you receive. When a person places his faith in Christ, he receives the Holy Spirit who now continues the ministry of Christ, and that will produce the spiritual re-birth – the new birth – that will put him into a relationship with God. But because the Holy Spirit is so closely identified with Christ, we will often talk about receiving Christ. There is nothing the matter with that, so long as we keep in mind and understand that Christ in terms of his human nature is with the Father. He is absent from this world. Some day he will return, but in his absence it is the Holy Spirit who continues his ministry to the world and to the church as well.

When we come to our later section on the doctrine of the Holy Spirit, we will look more at the manifold ministries that this third person of the Trinity has in the world today. But for now we simply want to note that the Holy Spirit is not the ghost of Jesus Christ. When people talk about the Holy Ghost they don't mean it is the ghost of Jesus. Nor do they mean by the Holy Spirit some sort of it – a thing, a neutral force or impersonal object. The Holy Spirit is a person just like the Son and the Father who is now at work in the world and in the church to carry on the ministry of Jesus.

That is the first point: the Holy Spirit is a person who is distinct from the Father and the Son.

Moreover, to state the obvious, the Holy Spirit is God. The Holy Spirit, like the Father and Son, is God.

Look at Matthew 12:28 for example. We read the words of Jesus: “But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.” Here he refers to the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of God who brings the Kingdom of God to Earth.

Acts 5:3-4 is a very interesting passage from the story about Ananias and Sapphira and God's judgment upon them.  Here Peter is rebuking Ananias for his deception. Peter says,

But Peter said, “Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back part of the proceeds of the land? While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? How is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God.”

Notice in verse 3, Peter says to Ananias, “why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit,” and then in verse 4 he says, “You have not lied to men but to God.” So the equation is made of the Holy Spirit with God. The Holy Spirit is deity.

Romans 8:9. We have already read this verse: “You are not in the flesh, you are in the Spirit if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you.” Here the Holy Spirit is, again, referred to as the Spirit of God.

Finally, 1 Corinthians 6:11. Paul says, “You were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.”

So the Holy Spirit is God and yet at the same time the Holy Spirit is distinct from the Father and the Son. We have the same truths about the Holy Spirit that we saw with regard to the Father and the Son. He is a distinct person, and he is divine.

Next time we will begin to look at how the early church reflected on this biblical data in order to make sense of it.


## Doctrine of Trinity (Part 5): Systematic Summary

C.  Systematic Summary

1.  Historical Survey of the Doctrine

The Difficulty of Expression
In summary, we have strong scriptural grounds for affirming that

There is exactly one God,
and

(2) There are exactly three distinct persons who are properly called God.

Now “A Trinity doctrine is commonly expressed as the statement that the one God exists as or in three equally divine ‘Persons’, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.”[1] It therefore follows that the NT teaches a doctrine of the Trinity. I’ll refer to this as the biblical doctrine of the Trinity.

We now want to turn to a historical survey of how great Christian thinkers have sought to formulate this doctrine into a systematic package.

b.  Logos Christology

We are going to begin with the early Greek apologists of the second century. These were men like Justin Martyr (100-165), Tatian (12-180), Theophilus (d. 183), Athenagoras (133-190), and so on. You might not have ever heard of these men but these were some of the earliest Christian authors writing in defense of the Christian faith during the second century. Since they wrote in Greek they are known collectively as the Greek apologists.

These thinkers sought to connect the divine Word of the prologue of John's Gospel – the Logos – who John says was in the beginning with God and who was God – with the Logos as it plays a role in the thought of the Jewish Hellenistic philosopher Philo of Alexandria. He lived in Alexandria in Egypt during the same time as Jesus. He was born in 25 BC and died in AD 40.

When we say that Philo was a Hellenistic Jew we mean is that he was heavily influenced in his thinking by Greek thought. Hellenistic comes from the Greek word hellene which means “Greek.” As a Hellenistic Jew, Philo’s thinking is pervaded by the categories of Greek philosophy, particularly, middle Platonism.

The Christian apologists attempted to use the work of Philo in connection with the Gospel of John to articulate a sort of Logos Christology, or a doctrine of Christ, based on Philo's thinking. For Philo, the Logos is the reason or the mind of God who created the world and who imbued the world with its rational structure. Similarly, these Greek apologists also believed that the Father existing alone before the creation of the world had within himself (immanent within himself) his reason or Word which existed in him prior to creation. Then somehow this Word proceeded forth from God the Father, rather as a spoken word proceeds forth from someone who utters that word, and it becomes a distinct individual from the Father. It was through this individual – through the Logos – that the Father created the world, and the Logos then ultimately became incarnate as Jesus of Nazareth.

This procession of the Logos from the mind of the Father could be conceived to take place at the moment of creation when God created the world – that was the moment at which the Logos proceeded from the Father's mind. Or else, alternatively, it could be thought to be an eternal procession that never had a beginning. The church fathers were fond of using the analogy of the sun's rays proceeding from the sun. As long as the sun exists – even if the sun had existed eternally – the light beams would always be proceeding from the sun. It is not as though they had a beginning to their procession. It was an eternal procession.

Let me read to you a statement by Athenagoras of this doctrine of the procession of the Logos, or the Son, from the Father. Here is what Athenagoras writes:

The Son of God is the Word of the Father in Ideal Form and energizing power; for in his likeness and through him all things came into existence, which presupposes that the Father and the Son are one. Now since the Son is in the Father and the Father in the Son by a powerful unity of Spirit, the Son of God is the mind and reason of the Father . . . He is the first begotten of the Father. The term is used not because he came into existence (for God, who is eternal mind, had in himself his word or reason from the beginning, since he was eternally rational) but because he came forth to serve as Ideal Form and Energizing Power for everything material. . . . The . . . Holy Spirit . . . we regard as an effluence of God which flows forth from him and returns like a ray of the sun.

This is from his treatise entitled A Plea for the Christians, chapter 10.

According to the Logos doctrine, there is only one God, but this God is not an undifferentiated unity. Rather certain aspects of his mind become expressed as distinct individuals.

The Logos doctrine of the Greek apologists thus involves a fundamental reinterpretation of the fatherhood of God. God is seen to be not merely the Father of all mankind or the Father of Israel or even simply the Father of Jesus of Nazareth. Rather he is the Father from whom the Logos is begotten before all worlds. The Logos is begotten of the Father from eternity. So Christ is not merely the only begotten Son of God in virtue of his incarnation. You might say that the reason Jesus is the only begotten Son of God is because he was born of a virgin, as in the Gospel of Luke. But what these Christian apologists were saying is that the Son is begotten of the Father even in his pre-incarnate deity. He proceeds out of the Father from eternity.

This Logos doctrine of the Greek apologists was taken up into Western theology by the great church father and theologian Irenaeus (130-202) in his treatise Against Heresies. Irenaeus identifies God's Word, or Logos, with the Son and he identifies God's Wisdom with the Holy Spirit. So God's Word is the Son; his Wisdom is the Holy Spirit. This then will be taken up into Western theology.

For better or worse, like it or not, the Logos doctrine of the Greek Apologists is one of the clearest examples of the influence of philosophical thinking upon theology because this doctrine (which then gets canonized at the Council of Nicaea later on) is formed out of a kind of synthesis between John's Gospel and the thought of Philo of Alexandria and the Middle Platonism that he represented.
