## The Influence of Greek Philosophy on Immutability

![](OmniPics/GreekPhilosophy.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Traditional Christian theology, influenced by Greek philosophy, embraced God's immutability as absolute changelessness.  
* Aristotle's **Unmoved Mover**:  
  * God was seen as utterly changeless, moving things only as an object of desire.  
  * Similar to how a statue inspires admiration without itself changing.  
* This view contrasts with the dynamic, interactive God of the Bible:  
  * The God of Scripture acts in history, interacts with people, and responds to prayer.  

---

## Immutability Orthodoxy

![](OmniPics/AngelOfGodStatue.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* The Bible teaches that God is unchanging in His:  
  * **Being**: Eternal and self-existent (Psalm 102:25-27)  
  * **Character**: Perfectly good and consistent (Malachi 3:6)  
  * **Faithfulness**: Reliable in His promises (Hebrews 6:17-18, Psalm 119:89-90)  
  * **Purpose**: His plans endure forever (Psalm 33:11)  
* The Bible also teaches some change in God
  * God often announced judgment for sin but showed mercy when man repented or prayed

## Reconciling Apparent Changes in God's Actions

![](OmniPics/GodChangeMind.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* God's actions reflect His unchanging nature but vary based on human behavior:  
  * **Discipline**: When humanity is disobedient or unrepentant  
  * **Mercy**: When humanity is obedient or repentant  
* Passages describing God "changing His mind" (e.g., Jonah 3:10, Exodus 32:14) are anthropomorphic:  
  * They reflect human perspective, not literal changes in God  
* God's omniscience ensures He knows all outcomes and adjusts His actions accordingly  
  * E.g., He knew Nineveh would repent and Moses would intercede  
* God's treatment of humanity changes as human attitudes and behaviors change, but His essence and purposes remain constant

## Immutable Attributes of God (J.I. Packer's Summary)

![](OmniPics/GodStatue.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

1. **God's Life**: Eternal and unchanging; He neither matures nor regresses
2. **God's Character**: His mercy, love, faithfulness, and justice never change
3. **God's Truth**: His word endures forever and remains trustworthy
4. **God's Ways**: Consistent in punishing sin and bestowing grace, though expressed differently across covenants
5. **God's Purposes**: His plans are eternal, unchanging, and fully informed by His foreknowledge

## The Incarnation and Immutability

![](OmniPics/BabyJesus.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* The incarnation involves the second person of the Trinity assuming a human nature:  
  * **No loss of divine attributes**: Jesus remained omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent in His divine nature.  
  * **Addition of a human nature**: Jesus became limited, temporal, and mortal in His human nature.  
* This change does not compromise God's perfection:  
  * The second person of the Trinity once did not have a human nature, but now does.  
  * This is a contingent change, not a change in God's eternal character or essence.

## Prayer and God's Immutability

![](OmniPics/GodPrayer.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **Prayer changes us**: It draws us closer to God, increases dependence on Him, and aligns us with His will.  
* **Prayer affects God's actions**:  
  * God foreknew our prayers from eternity and incorporates them into His plans.  
  * If we fail to pray, God may withhold blessings He would otherwise grant.  
* **Prayer does not change God's mind**:  
  * God's responses to prayer are part of His eternal, unchanging plan.
