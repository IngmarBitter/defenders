## Omnipresence in Psalm 139:7-12

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    Where can I go from Your Spirit?  
    Or where can I flee from Your presence?  
    If I ascend into heaven, You are there;  
    If I make my bed in hell, behold, You are there.  
    If I take the wings of the morning,  
    And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,  
    Even there Your hand shall lead me,  
    And Your right hand shall hold me.  
    If I say, “Surely the darkness shall fall on me,”  
    Even the night shall be light about me;  
    Indeed, the darkness shall not hide from You,  
    But the night shines as the day;  
    The darkness and the light are both alike to You.  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -2em;">    <em>Psalm 139:7-12 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Whereever we God, God is there
* We cannot hide nor be lost
* He is inescapeable and accessible

## Omnipresence in Jeremiah 23:23-24

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "Am I a God near at hand," says the Lord,<br>  
    "And not a God afar off?<br>  
    Can anyone hide himself in secret places,<br>  
    So I shall not see him?" says the Lord;<br>  
    "Do I not fill heaven and earth?" says the Lord.  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -2em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Jeremiah 23:23-24 (NKJV)</em></p>

* God is both near and far
* His presence fills heaven and earth
* No one can hide from Him

---

## Omnipresence in 1 Kings 8:27

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "But will God indeed dwell on the earth?<br>  
    Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain You.<br>  
    How much less this temple which I have built!"  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>1 Kings 8:27 (NKJV)</em></p>

* God's presence is not localized but beyond all creation
* Even the heavens cannot contain Him
* Highlights God's transcendence and majesty

---

## Omnipresence in Acts 17:24,28a

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    24 "God, who made the world and everything in it,<br>  
    since He is Lord of heaven and earth,<br>  
    does not dwell in temples made with hands."<br><br>  
    28 "For in Him we live and move and have our being."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Acts 17:24,28a (NKJV)</em></p>

* God is the Creator of all things
* His presence is not confined to man-made structures
* In Him, we find our existence and sustenance
* Emphasizes God's sovereignty and immanence

---

## Omnipresence in Proverbs 18:24

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "A man who has friends must himself be friendly,<br>  
    But there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Proverbs 18:24 (NKJV)</em></p>

* God is the ultimate friend who is always present
* His closeness surpasses even the strongest human relationships
* Highlights God's faithfulness, intimacy, and omnipresence

---

## Omnipresence

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* God is **Present Everywhere**
  * No place exists where God is absent
  * Not limited by space or physical boundaries
* **Not Pantheism** (The universe is God's body)
  * God transcends it; His presence permeates creation without being confined to it
* God **sustains all things** by His presence
* **Comfort**: God is always near in times of need, "closer than a brother"
* **Accountability**: No sin or action escapes His awareness

## Is God ***Spacial*** or Aspacial?

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "The Lord is in His holy temple,<br>
    The Lord’s throne is in heaven;<br>
    His eyes behold,<br>
    His eyelids test the sons of men."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Psalm 11:4 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Sounds like a spacial description of God
* Possibly: **Anthropomorphic Language**  
  * Descriptions of God sitting on His throne or looking at us are figurative
  * Points to God’s transcendence rather than literal spatiality

---

## Is God Spacial or ***Aspacial***? (Part 1)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "Behold My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself. Handle Me and see, for **a spirit does not have flesh and bones** as you see I have."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -2em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Luke 24:39 (NKJV), epmahasis added</em></p>

* Jesus defines spirit as without flesh and bones

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "**God is Spirit**, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>John 4:24 (NKJV), emphasis added</em></p>

* **God is Spirit**  
  * God is incorporeal and immaterial, not a physical being.  

---

## Is God Spacial or ***Aspacial***? (Part 2)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "Now to the King eternal, immortal, **invisible**, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -2em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>1 Timothy 1:17 (NKJV), emphasis added</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "He is the image of the **invisible God**, the firstborn over all creation."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Colossians 1:15 (NKJV), emphasis added</em></p>

* **God’s Invisibility**  
  * God is described as invisible, further supporting His incorporeal nature
  * God’s essence is beyond physical perception

---

## Is God Spacial or ***Aspacial***? (Part 3)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "Take careful heed to yourselves, for **you saw no form when the Lord spoke** to you at Horeb out of the midst of the fire, lest you act corruptly and make for yourselves a carved image in the form of any figure: the likeness of male or female."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -2em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Deuteronomy 4:15-16 (NKJV)</em></p>

* **God Has No Physical Form**  
  * God explicitly warns against creating physical representations of Him.  
  * His nature is not confined to any physical likeness.

## Creation of Time and Space in Genesis 1:1

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Genesis 1:1 (NKJV)</em></p>

* In Genesis 1:1, God:  
  * Creates the universe  
  * Creates and starts time  
  * Enters into time  
  * Also enters into space?  
    * Not clear from the Bible  
    * Needs philosophical analysis

---

## Systematic Analysis: Avoiding Errors

* **God is not localized in an earthly spot**  
  * The church is not God's "house" in a localized sense
  * Sacred sites are set apart for worship but do not contain God
  * Yet, God is present everywhere

* **God is not localized in heaven**  
  * God is not a humanoid being sitting on a throne in heaven (John 4:24)
  * God fills heaven and earth (Jeremiah 23:24)
  * Heaven and earth cannot contain Him (1 Kings 8:27)

---

## Systematic Analysis: Relating to Space

* **Key Question**:  
  * Is God everywhere in space, or does He transcend space altogether?

* Psalm 139 portrays God as present everywhere in space
* Many verses views God as Spirit:  
  * God is incorporeal and immaterial
  * He is not a localized three-dimensional object
  * Transcending space
* Compatible if Psalm 139 is Anthropomorphic Language

---

## Ether Misconception

* **God is not diffused throughout space**:  
  * God is not like an invisible ether or vapor spread across space
  * This view would imply:
    * God is finite if the universe is finite
    * God has a shape and size
    * God is only partially present at any given point

* **God is wholly present everywhere**:  
  * God is fully present at every point in space.  

---

## Analogy of the Soul

* **Analogy**:  
  * The soul is wholly present in the body, not spread out like a ghost
  * When I slap or trick you, it was me, not my had or foot
  * Similarly, God is wholly present at every point in space

* **Key Difference**:  
  * The world is not God's body
  * God does not use the world as a sense organ to perceive events

---

## Systematic Analysis: Challenges of Spatiality

* **Geometrical Properties**:  
  * If God is wholly present at every point
    * Is He so small He fits into a point?
    * Is he replicated infinitely?

* **Transcendence Over Space**:  
  * God is the creator of space and existed without it
  * God’s existence does not require space

---

## Systematic Analysis: Creation of Space

* **Creation of Space**:  
  * Space came into being when God created the physical world
  * Creation is a temporal act, not a spatial one

* **God and Space**:  
  * Unlike time, creating space does not "spatialize" God
  * God transcends space rather than entering into it

---

## Systematic Analysis: Omnipresence Defined

* **Omnipresence**:  
  * God is cognizant of and causally active at every point in space
  * God’s omnipresence means:
    * He knows what is happening everywhere
    * He sustains and causes events at every point in space

* **God as a Transcendent Mind**:  
  * God is a non-spatial, infinite mind
  * He is conscious of and active at every point in space

---

## Systematic Analysis: Fundamental Truth

* **Key Takeaway**:  
  * There is no place to which God’s knowledge and power do not extend

* **Application**:  
  * God’s omnipresence assures us of His sovereignty and accessibility  
  * This truth has profound implications for our personal lives

---

## Omniscience

![](KnowingGodPics/Omniscience.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* God is all-knowing
* Knows past, present, and future
* Wisdom and guidance for believers

---

## Omnipotence

![](KnowingGodPics/Omnipotence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* God is all-powerful
* Can do all things consistent with His nature
* Source of strength and hope for believers
