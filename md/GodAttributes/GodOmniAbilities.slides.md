## Omnipresence in Psalm 139:7-12

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    Where can I go from Your Spirit?  
    Or where can I flee from Your presence?  
    If I ascend into heaven, You are there;  
    If I make my bed in hell, behold, You are there.  
    If I take the wings of the morning,  
    And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,  
    Even there Your hand shall lead me,  
    And Your right hand shall hold me.  
    If I say, “Surely the darkness shall fall on me,”  
    Even the night shall be light about me;  
    Indeed, the darkness shall not hide from You,  
    But the night shines as the day;  
    The darkness and the light are both alike to You.  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -2em;">    <em>Psalm 139:7-12 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Wherever we go, God is there.
* Shows God’s care, not just His location
* We cannot hide nor be lost
* He is both, inescapeable and accessible

---

## Omnipresence in Jeremiah 23:23-24

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "Am I a God near at hand," says the Lord,<br>  
    "And not a God afar off?<br>  
    Can anyone hide himself in secret places,<br>  
    So I shall not see him?" says the Lord;<br>  
    "Do I not fill heaven and earth?" says the Lord.  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -2em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Jeremiah 23:23-24 (NKJV)</em></p>

* God is both near and far
* His presence fills heaven and earth
* No one can hide from Him

---

## Omnipresence in Proverbs 18:24

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "A man who has friends must himself be friendly,<br>  
    But there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Proverbs 18:24 (NKJV)</em></p>

* God is the ultimate friend who is always present
* His closeness surpasses even the strongest human relationships
* Highlights God's faithfulness, intimacy, and omnipresence
* God’s presence makes Him the ultimate, ever-close friend

---

## Omnipresence in 1 Kings 8:27

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "But will God indeed dwell on the earth?<br>  
    Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain You.<br>  
    How much less this temple which I have built!"  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>1 Kings 8:27 (NKJV)</em></p>

* God's presence is not localized but beyond all creation
* Even the heavens cannot contain Him
* Highlights God's transcendence and majesty

---

## Omnipresence in Acts 17:24,28a

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    24 "God, who made the world and everything in it,<br>  
    since He is Lord of heaven and earth,<br>  
    does not dwell in temples made with hands."<br><br>  
    28 "For in Him we live and move and have our being."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Acts 17:24,28a (NKJV)</em></p>

* God is the Creator of all things
* His presence is not confined to man-made structures
* In Him, we find our existence and sustenance
* Emphasizes God's sovereignty and immanence

---

## Omnipresence

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* God is **Present Everywhere**
  * No place exists where God is absent
* God **transcends** space
  * Not limited by space or physical boundaries
  * Not defined by space or stuff (as in Pantheism)
  * His presence permeates creation without being confined to it
* God **sustains all creation** by His presence
* <span style="color: lime;">**Comfort**: God is near "closer than a brother", incl. in times of need</span>
* <span style="color: red;">**Accountability**: No sin escapes His awareness</span>

## Is God ***Spatial*** or Aspatial?

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "The Lord is in His holy temple,<br>
    The Lord’s throne is in heaven;<br>
    His eyes behold,<br>
    His eyelids test the sons of men."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Psalm 11:4 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Sounds like a spatial description of God
* Possibly: **Anthropomorphic Language**  
  * **Figurative**: Throne and eyes symbolize authority, not body parts
  * Points to God’s authority and transcendence, not literal spatiality

---

## Is God Spatial or ***Aspatial***? God is Spirit

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "Behold My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself. Handle Me and see, for **a spirit does not have flesh and bones** as you see I have."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -2em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Luke 24:39 (NKJV), emphasis added</em></p>

* Jesus defines spirit as without flesh and bones

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "**God is Spirit**, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>John 4:24 (NKJV), emphasis added</em></p>

* **God is Spirit**  
  * God is incorporeal and immaterial, not a physical being

---

## Is God Spatial or ***Aspatial***? God is Invisible

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "Now to the King eternal, immortal, **invisible**, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -2em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>1 Timothy 1:17 (NKJV), emphasis added</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "He is the image of the **invisible God**, the firstborn over all creation."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Colossians 1:15 (NKJV), emphasis added</em></p>

* **God’s Invisibility**  
  * God is described as invisible, further supporting His incorporeal nature
  * God’s essence transcends physical sight

---

## Is God Spatial or ***Aspatial***? God is Without Form

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "Take careful heed to yourselves, for **you saw no form when the Lord spoke** to you at Horeb out of the midst of the fire, lest you act corruptly and make for yourselves a carved image in the form of any figure: the likeness of male or female."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -2em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Deuteronomy 4:15-16 (NKJV)</em></p>

* **God Has No Physical Form**  
  * God explicitly warns against creating physical representations of Him.  
  * His nature is not confined to any physical likeness.  

---

## Systematic Analysis: Creation of Time & Space (Genesis 1:1)

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Genesis 1:1 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Creation begins time and space (Gen 1:1):
  * Time: God enters to engage a changing world
  * Space: God acts without entering
* Why not enter space?
  * He already knows and sustains all space as a non-spatial mind
  * Later, in Jesus, God opts into space—limiting physical presence

---

## Systematic Analysis: Avoiding Errors

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **God is not localized in an earthly spot**  
  * The church is not God's "house" in a localized sense
  * Sacred sites are set apart for worship but do not contain God
  * Yet, God is present everywhere

* **God is not localized in heaven**  
  * God is not a humanoid being sitting on a throne in heaven (John 4:24)
  * God fills heaven and earth (Jeremiah 23:24)
  * Heaven and earth cannot contain Him (1 Kings 8:27)

---

## Systematic Analysis: Relating to Space

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Does God Live in Space?
  * Psalm 139: God seems everywhere in space
  * But God is Spirit (John 4:24):
    * No body, no limits (incorporeal & immaterial)
    * Transcends space entirely
* Solution: Psalm 139 uses anthropomorphic and figurative language
  * Shows God’s care, not His location
  * Similar Psalm 11:4 shows authority, not body parts

---

## Ether Misconception

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **God is not spread out like a gas**:  
  * God is not like an invisible ether or vapor spread across space
  * This view would imply:
    * God is finite if the universe is finite
    * God has a shape and size
    * God is only partially present at any given point

* **God is wholly present everywhere**:  
  * God is fully present at every point in space.  

---

## Challenges of Wholly Present

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* If God is wholly present at every point
  * Is He so small He fits into a point?
  * Is He replicated infinitely?

* Wholly presence is not:
  * 100% of God is present there
* But is:
  * God's presence is 100% effective there
  * God is fully Himself at every point, not divided

---

## Analogy of the Soul

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **Analogy**:  
  * When I slap or trip you, it was me, not my hand or foot
    * The soul is wholly present in all parts of our body
    * Not spread out and thinned out like a ghost
  * Similarly, God is wholly present at every point in space
  * God’s presence fills space like this, but isn’t limited by it

* **Key Difference**:  
  * The world is not God's body
  * God does not use the world as a sense organ to perceive events

---

## Systematic Analysis: Creation of Space

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **Creation’s Impact**:  
  * Space begins with the physical world
  * Time draws God in; space doesn’t
* **God’s Relation to Space**:  
  * Space leaves God transcendent
  * He shapes space without a spatial nature
* **Transcendence**:  
  * God made space and existed without it
  * Space isn’t needed for God’s existence

---

## Systematic Analysis: Omnipresence Defined

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **Omnipresence**:  
  * God is cognizant of and causally active at every point in space
  * God’s omnipresence means:
    * He knows what is happening everywhere
    * He sustains and causes events at every point in space

* **God as a Transcendent Mind**:  
  * God is a non-spatial, infinite mind
  * He is conscious of and active at every point in space

---

## Systematic Analysis: Fundamental Truth

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **Key Takeaway**:  
  * There is no place to which God’s knowledge and power do not extend

* **Application**:  
  * God’s omnipresence assures us of His sovereignty and accessibility  
  * This truth has profound implications for our personal lives

---

## Application of Omnipresence

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* How does God’s omnipresence shape our lives?
  * No place is beyond His reach
  * His presence offers practical impact
* Two key applications:
  * We can contact God anywhere
  * We should practice His presence daily

---

## Contacting God Anywhere

![](OmniPics/GodHandsEarth.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* God is present at every location
  * Call on Him — He answers “Present!”
  * San Francisco, Munich, Rio: He’s there
* Personal experience:
  * Travel abroad? God’s reality stays the same
  * No matter where you are, He’s reachable
* Matthew 28:20:
  * “I am with you always, even to the end of the age”

---

## Practicing God’s Presence

![](OmniPics/FriendBehind.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Be aware of God with us
  * Not emotion, but constant awareness
  * He’s not distant — He’s here
* Especially in temptation:
  * God watches — sin’s harder in His presence
* Prayer shift:
  * Don’t ask “Be with us” — He already is
  * Thank Him, or pray for specific help (e.g., strength, guidance)

---

## Comfort in God’s Presence

![](OmniPics/ComfortinGodsPresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,<br>
    I fear no evil, for Thou art with me."
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Psalm 23:4 (NKJV)</em></p>

* God is with us in all circumstances:
  * Work, study, ministry, persecution
  * Illness, even death — no one is alone
* His omnipresence brings unshakable comfort

---

## Omniscience

![](KnowingGodPics/Omniscience.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* God is all-knowing
* Knows past, present, and future
* Wisdom and guidance for believers

---

## Omnipotence

![](KnowingGodPics/Omnipotence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* God is all-powerful
* Can do all things consistent with His nature
* Source of strength and hope for believers
