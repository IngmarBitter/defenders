## *Aseity*, Necessary Existence, Eternality

![](InfinityPics/Aseity.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* ***Aseity***
  * From the Latin **a se** ("from itself")
  * God is self-existent: He exists entirely by His own nature
  * His existence is independent of anything else
  * He does not depend on anything external for its existence
* **Necessary Existence**
* **Eternality**

## Aseity, *Necessary Existence*, Eternality

![](InfinityPics/Necessary.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **Aseity**
  * God is self-existent: He exists entirely by His own nature
* ***Necessary Existence***
  * Existence forced by and grounded in logic
  * It doesn’t just happen to exist (like contingent things such as humans or trees)
  * It is impossible for a necessarily existing being to not exist
  * Its non-existence is logically or metaphysically impossible
  * Its existence is true in all possible worlds
* **Eternality**

## Aseity, Necessary Existence, *Eternality*

![](InfinityPics/Eternality.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **Aseity**
  * God is self-existent: He exists entirely by His own nature
* **Necessary Existence**
  * Existence in all possible worlds through logic
* ***Eternality***
  * Existing either timelessly or without beginning or end in time
  * An eternal being doesn’t come into existence or cease to exist

### Exodus 3:14: 'I am who I am'

![](InfinityPics/BurningBush.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    Then Moses said to God, “If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ what shall I say to them?” God said to Moses, “**I am who I am.**” And he said, “Say this to the people of Israel, ‘I am has sent me to you.’” ... ‘The Lord, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you’: **this is my name for ever**, and thus I am to be remembered throughout all generations.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Exodus 3:13-15 (NKJV), emphasis added</em></p>

* Divine name “I am that I am” (Ex 3.14)
  * Revealed by God Himself
  * Points to aseity (self-existence)

## Isaiah 40: Everlasting God

![](InfinityPics/GodSittingOnEarth.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif; font-size: 0.8em">
    All nations before Him are as nothing, And they are counted by Him less than nothing and worthless. To whom then will you liken God? Or what likeness will you compare to Him? ... It is He who sits above the circle of the earth, And its inhabitants are like grasshoppers, Who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, And spreads them out like a tent to dwell in. ... The **everlasting God**, the Lord, The **Creator of the ends of the earth**, Neither faints nor is weary. His understanding is unsearchable.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -2.5em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Isaiah 40:17-23, 28a (NKJV), emphasis added</em></p>

* Everlasting and universe creation
  * Attributes of divine aseity

## New Testament on Aseity (Self-Existence)

![](InfinityPics/JesusOnMobius.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>John 1:1-3 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    You are worthy, O Lord, To receive glory and honor and power; For You created all things, And by Your will they exist and were created.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Revelation 4:11 (NKJV)</em></p>

* God already existed at the beginning and all things were created by God
  * Attributes of divine aseity

## God as Creator and Sustainer

![](InfinityPics/GodWithEarthAndAngles.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    You alone are the Lord; You have made heaven, The heaven of heavens, with all their host, The earth and everything on it, The seas and all that is in them, And You preserve them all. The host of heaven worships You.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Nehemiah 9:6 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    For of Him and through Him and to Him are all things, to whom be glory forever. Amen.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Romans 11:36 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Universe creation and preservation
  * Universe depends on God, not vice versa
  * Attributes of divine aseity

## Christ's Aseity (Self-Existence)

![](InfinityPics/JesusHoldingEarth.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as there are many gods and many lords), yet for us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and through whom we live.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>1 Corinthians 8:5-6 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    God, who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets, has in these last days spoken to us by His Son, whom He has appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the worlds; who being the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power, when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Hebrews 1:1-3a (NKJV)</em></p>

* Universe creation and upholding by Christ
  * Universe depends on Christ, not vice versa
  * Attributes of divine aseity

## Systematic Summary

![](InfinityPics/Aseity.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **Aseity Definition**
  * From the Latin **a se** ("from itself")
  * God is self-existent: He exists entirely by His own nature
  * His existence is independent of anything else
  * He does not depend on anything external for its existence
* **Implications for God**
  * All finite reality depends on God for creation, preservation, and future existence
  * God is radically independent, unlike any other being
  * Aseity is the foundation for His necessary existence and eternality

---

## Solving Problems with Aseity

![](InfinityPics/Warrior2.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **God is not just one being among many**
  * All other beings depend on God for their existence
  * Other gods (likely fallen angels, deamons)
* **Answering "Where did God come from?"**
  * God is self-existent, did not come from anywhere, and always existed
  * The question assumes there was a state without God
  * The question is meaningless once God's nature is understood
* **Numbers are not eternal beings**
  * Numbers have various interpretations, many are no challenge

---

## The Existence of Numbers and Friends

![](InfinityPics/Platonism.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **Numbers, virtues, vices, properties, principles**
  * Can be ascribed to God
  * Thus co-eternal with God
  * Thus necessarily existing
* **Question: What does *existing* mean for an abstract object?**
  * Could challenge God’s uniqueness as the sole self existing being

## Numbers and Friends Existence Chart I

![](InfinityPics/MathObjectsExistence.jpg style="float: right; width: 19rem")

* **Exist (realism) 40%**
* **Not Exist (anti-realism, nominalism) 38%**
* **Not applicable (arealism) 23%**
  
* Concrete objects, incl. thoughts can have causual power
* Abstract objects cannot

## Numbers and Friends Existence Chart II

![](InfinityPics/MathObjectsExistence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-size: 0.6em; line-height: 1em; margin-top: -0.2em;">***Not applicable (arealism)* 23%**</p>
  <p style="font-size: 0.6em; line-height: 1em; margin-top: -0.2em;">**- Conventionalism**: numbers fail verification principle, so not real nor truth</p>
<p style="font-size: 0.6em; line-height: 1em; margin-top: -0.0em;">***Exist (realism)* 40%**</p>
  <p style="font-size: 0.6em; line-height: 1em; margin-top: -0.2em;">**- Platonism**: Numbers exist independently of God and minds, uncreated and eternal (non-sence?)</p>
  <p style="font-size: 0.6em; line-height: 1em; margin-top: -0.2em;">**- Divine Conceptualism** Numbers are ideas in God’s mind, dependent on His intellect (can we have God's thoughts?)</p>
  <p style="font-size: 0.6em; line-height: 1em; margin-top: -0.2em;">**- Absolute Creationism** God creates numbers (faces the bootstrapping objection)</p>
  <p style="font-size: 0.6em; line-height: 1em; margin-top: -0.2em;">**- Psychologism** (<5%, rare): Numbers are human thoughts, varying by individual minds</p>
<p style="font-size: 0.6em; line-height: 1em; margin-top: -0.0em;">***Not Exist (anti-realism, nominalism)* 38%**: Abstract objects do not exist; they are merely names or linguistic conventions</p>
  <p style="font-size: 0.6em; line-height: 1em; margin-top: -0.2em;">**- Fictionalism**: Numbers are useful fictions, not truths about real entities (Sherlock Holmes)</p>
  <p style="font-size: 0.6em; line-height: 1em; margin-top: -0.2em;">**- Figuralism**: Numbers are mental constructs of humans, not independent objects (thus not true)</p>
  <p style="font-size: 0.6em; line-height: 1em; margin-top: -0.2em;">**- Modal Structuralism**: Numbers do not exist, but if they did, then 2 + 2 = 4</p>
  <p style="font-size: 0.6em; line-height: 1em; margin-top: -0.2em;">**- Free Logic**: Allows reference to non-existent objects without implying their reality, excl. "There is a hole."</p>
  <p style="font-size: 0.6em; line-height: 1em; margin-top: -0.2em;">**- Neutralism**: As free logic, but incl "There is a hole" does not make the hole exist</p>
  <p style="font-size: 0.6em; line-height: 1em; margin-top: -0.2em;">**- Neo-Meinongianism**: Being (has properties) vs. existence (part of reality). Numbers have being, not existence.</p>

## Necessary Existence

### Scriptural Data: 'I am who I am'

![](InfinityPics/LightOnWords.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    Then Moses said to God, “If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ what shall I say to them?” God said to Moses, “**I am who I am.**” And he said, “Say this to the people of Israel, ‘I am has sent me to you.’” ... ‘The Lord, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you’: **this is my name for ever**, and thus I am to be remembered throughout all generations.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Exodus 3:13-15 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Divine name “I am that I am” (Ex 3.14)
  * Revealed by God Himself
  * Points to self-existence (aseity) as the basis for necessary existence

---

## Understanding the Divine Name

![](InfinityPics/LightOnWords.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Divine name not given by humans but revealed by God
* Proper names reveal character in ancient Israel
* "I am who I am": not a given name. He just exists
  * Grounded in aseity: God's existence depends on nothing else
* Aristotle: Eternal == necessarily existing
* Ancient Hebrews: Concept of God as eternal and necessary
* OT scholars: Diverse interpretations of the divine name

---

## Scriptural Support

![](InfinityPics/LightOnWords.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* "I am who I am" (Ex 3.14)
  * Implies self-existence (aseity)
  * Implies not coming into existence
  * Implies uncaused
  * Implies not contingent
  * Implies necessary existence

---

## Anselm's Ontological Argument

![](InfinityPics/LightOnWords.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

1. It is **possible** that a maximally great being (God) exists
   * Great-making properties are existence, eternality, love, ...
2. Implies a maximally great being exists in some possible world
3. Implies it exists in every possible world
   * Since existence is a great-making property
   * Aseity ensures existence even in an "empty" world
4. Implies it exists in the actual world
5. Implies a maximally great being exists
6. Therefore, a maximally great being (God) exists - necessarily

---

## Philosophical and Theological Reasons

![](InfinityPics/LightOnWords.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **Philosophical**
  * Ontological argument: necessary existence in any possible world
  * Leibniz’s cosmological argument from contingency: all else depends on God
  * Moral argument: Foundation for objectivity of moral values
* **Theological**
  * Aseity shows necessary existence is not contingent nor accidental

---

## Theological Implications

![](InfinityPics/LightOnWords.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* God who exists accidentally vs. necessarily
* Worship and adoration: Appropriate for a necessarily existent God
* Factual necessity vs. metaphysical necessity

---

## Necessary Existence Summary

![](InfinityPics/LightOnWords.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **"I am who I am"** (Ex 3.14)
  * Implies not coming into existence, uncaused, not contingent, necessary existence
* **Philosophical reasons**
  * Various arguments for God conclude God must exist
* **Theological Implications**
  * God exists necessarily: deserves worship and adoration
* **Conclusion**
  * God exists in every possible world
  * Deep reverence and awe for God

* "I am who I am" (Ex 3.14)
  * Implies not coming into existence, uncaused, not contingent, necessary existence
* Philosophical reasons
  * Aseity, Ontological argument, other God existence arguments
* Theological Implications
  * A self-existent, necessary God deserves worship and adoration
