## Omniscience

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* God is all-knowing
* Knows past, present, and future
* Wisdom and guidance for believers

---

## Slide 2: Defining Omniscience

* From Latin: omni (all) + scientia (knowledge)  
* God possesses all knowledge  
* Complete and perfect  
* Infinite in scope  
* An intellectual attribute of God  

---

## Slide 3: Psalm 139:1-6 on Omniscience

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    1 O LORD, You have searched me and known me.<br>
    2 You know my sitting down and my rising up;<br>
    You understand my thought afar off.<br>
    3 You comprehend my path and my lying down, And are acquainted with all my ways.<br>
    4 For there is not a word on my tongue, But behold, O LORD, You know it altogether.<br>
    5 You have hedged me behind and before, And laid Your hand upon me.<br>
    6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; It is high, I cannot attain it.
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Psalm 139:1-6 (NKJV)</em></p>

* A poetic marvel at God’s knowledge  
* God sees everything that happens  
* From the ends of the earth to tiniest details  
* Nothing escapes His awareness  

---

## Slide 5: Evidence of God’s Event Knowledge

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "For He looks to the ends of the earth,  
    And sees under the whole heavens."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em;">    <em>Job 28:24 (NKJV)</em></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "The eyes of the LORD are in every place,  
    Keeping watch on the evil and the good."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em;">    <em>Proverbs 15:3 (NKJV)</em></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "But the very hairs of your head are all numbered."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Matthew 10:30 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Evidence of God’s awareness in all events  

---

## Slide 6: God Knows Our Thoughts

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "The Lord searches all hearts and understands  
    all the intent of the thoughts."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em;">    <em>1 Chronicles 28:9 (NKJV)</em></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    [...] all things are naked and open to the eyes  
    of Him to whom we must give account."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Hebrews 4:13 (NKJV)</em></p>

* God reads the secret thoughts of every person  
* Inner motives and plans laid bare  
* He searches every heart

---

## Slide 8: God Knows the Future

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "Even before a word is on my tongue,  
    Behold, O Lord, You know it altogether."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em;">    <em>Psalm 139:4 (NKJV)</em></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "In Your book they all were written,  
    The days fashioned for me,  
    When as yet there were none of them."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Psalm 139:16 (NKJV)</em></p>

* God’s foreknowledge spans all time  
* Knows our words before we speak  
* Days written before we’re born
* Hard to explain on Open Theism 
  * (where God does not know the future)

---

## Slide 10: Prophecy Proves Deity

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "Declare to us the things to come... that  
    we may know that you are gods."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Isaiah 41:22-23 (NKJV)</em></p>

* God challenges the little g gods to tell the future
* They cannot, thus they are not really divine
* Foreknowledge of the future distinguishes the true God  

---

## Slide 11: Jesus’ Foreknowledge

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "Jesus said to him, 'Assuredly, I say to you that this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.'"  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -2em;">    <em>Matthew 26:34 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "Jesus answered, 'It is he to whom I shall give a piece of bread when I have dipped it.' And having dipped the bread, He gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em;">    <em>John 13:26 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "Now as He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, 'Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?'"  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -2em;">    <em>Matthew 24:3 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Jesus predicted:  
  * Peter’s denial, Judas’ betrayal, Signs of the end times  
* Demonstrates divine omniscience  

---

## Slide 12: God Knows what-if-truths

![](OmniPics/Omnipresence.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    David inquired of the Lord about saving Keilah from the Philistines, and God assured him of victory.  
    After defeating the Philistines, David learned that Saul planned to attack Keilah.  
    David asked God if Saul would come and if the people of Keilah would betray him.  
    God revealed that both would happen, so David and his men fled.  
    Saul was informed of this and turned his army around.
</p>

* God knew what would happen if David stayed: Saul would attack  
* However, David left, so it didn’t occur
* This shows God’s knowledge of what would occur under different circumstances.
