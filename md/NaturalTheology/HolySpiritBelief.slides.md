## Scripture: The Spirit's Assurance of Adoption

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, "Abba, Father!"
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -2em; margin-bottom: -0.5em;"> <em>Galatians 4:6 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -2em; margin-bottom: -0.5em;"> <em>Romans 8:16 (NKJV)</em></p>

* The Holy Spirit assures believers of their adoption as children of God.

## Scripture: The Spirit's Teaching and Guidance

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know all things... But the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you do not need that anyone teach you; but as the same anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you will abide in Him.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -2em; margin-bottom: -0.5em;"> <em>1 John 2:20, 27 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -0.5em;"> <em>John 14:26 (NKJV)</em></p>

* The Holy Spirit teaches believers the great truths of the Gospel and helps us to remember them.

---

## The Self-Authenticating Witness of the Holy Spirit (Expanded)

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* 1. The Holy Spirit provides a **veridical and unmistakable experience**.
* 2. No need for supplementary arguments; it is direct knowledge.
* 3. Not an argument from religious experience but immediate awareness.
* 4. Apprehends Christian truths like "God exists."
* 5. Provides both subjective assurance and objective knowledge.
* 6. Overwhelms contrary arguments with its warrant.

---

## 1. Veridical and Unmistakable

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* The experience of the Holy Spirit is genuine and cannot be mistaken for something else.
* But it is not **irresistible** or **indubitable**; through sin, we can quench or resist the Holy Spirit.
* Examples:
  * A believer feels an undeniable sense of God's presence during prayer, distinct from any other emotion or thought.
  * A person in deep personal need experiences unexpected peace and help and knows it was through the Holy Spirit's intervention.

---

## 2. No Need for Supplementary Arguments

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* The Holy Spirit's witness provides direct knowledge of God without requiring additional evidence.
* Examples:
  * A new Christian, without theological training, confidently knows they are reconciled to God.
  * A believer facing doubts finds reassurance through the Spirit's presence, without needing external validation.

---

## 3. Not an Argument from Religious Experience

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* The witness is not a premise in an argument but an immediate experience of God.
* Examples:
  * Like knowing the external world exists without needing to argue for it, a believer directly experiences God's presence.
  * A person overwhelmed by the beauty of creation feels an immediate connection to God, without reasoning through it.

---

## 4. Apprehension of Christian Truths

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* The Holy Spirit enables believers to grasp truths like "God exists" or "I am reconciled to God."
* Examples:
  * A person under conviction of sin realizes their need for reconciliation with God.
  * A believer gains clarity about their purpose in life, understanding it as part of God's plan.

---

## 5. Subjective Assurance and Objective Knowledge

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* The Holy Spirit provides both personal assurance and objective knowledge of Christianity's truth.
* Examples:
  * A believer feels peace about their salvation while also knowing it is grounded in Christ's work.
  * A person studying Scripture experiences a deep conviction of its truth, beyond intellectual understanding.

---

## 6. Overwhelms Contrary Arguments

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* The Spirit's witness outweighs objections and provides greater warrant for belief.
* Even when a believer cannot answer objections, the Spirit's witness provides such assurance that it overwhelms contrary arguments.
* Examples:
  * A believer remains confident in their faith despite philosophical arguments against Christianity.
  * Someone facing criticism for their beliefs finds strength in the Spirit's assurance, overriding doubts raised by others.
  * Basic belief in the illusion of the external world is overwhelmed by the Spirit's witness affirming a real word.

---

## The Witness of the Holy Spirit Grounds Christian Belief as Properly Basic

![](NatTheoPics/Experience.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* The witness of the Holy Spirit provides a **properly basic foundation** for Christian belief.
* It is akin to:
  * The immediate experience of the external world.
  * The reality of the past.
* This belief is not based on evidence or argument but is **appropriately grounded** in the Spirit's witness.
* It offers both **subjective assurance** and **objective knowledge** of Christianity's truth - it is **self-authenticating**.

## Scripture: The Holy Spirit's Ministry to the World

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    Nevertheless I tell you the truth. It is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send Him to you. And when He has come, He will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: of sin, because they do not believe in Me; of righteousness, because I go to My Father and you see Me no more; of judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;"> <em>John 16:7-11 (NKJV)</em></p>

* The Holy Spirit convicts the world of:
  * **Sin**: Awareness of their separation from God.
  * **Righteousness**: God's moral standard.
  * **Judgment**: The reality of divine justice.

---

## Scripture: Seeking God and Knowing the Truth

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    As it is written: "There is none righteous, no, not one; There is none who understands; There is none who seeks after God."
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;"> <em>Romans 3:10-11 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    Jesus answered them and said, "My doctrine is not Mine, but His who sent Me. If anyone wills to do His will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it is from God or whether I speak on My own authority."
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;"> <em>John 7:16-17 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Without the Spirit's work, no one seeks God.
* Those who truly seek God's will shall know the truth of His teaching.

---

## Scripture: The Spirit's Drawing Power

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last day.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -2em; margin-bottom: -0.5em;"> <em>John 6:44 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    My doctrine is not Mine, but His who sent Me. If anyone wills to do His will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it is from God or whether I speak on My own authority.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -2em; margin-bottom: -0.5em;"> <em>John 7:16-17 (NKJV)</em></p>

* The Spirit draws unbelievers to Christ, enabling them to know the truth of the Gospel.

# The Role of the Holy Spirit for Unbelievers

---

## The Role of the Holy Spirit for Unbelievers

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* No indwelling nor inner witness for unbelievers
* The Holy Spirit convicts unbelievers of:
  1. **Sin**: Awareness of their separation from God.
  2. **Righteousness**: God's moral standard.
  3. **Judgment**: The reality of divine justice.
* Without the Spirit's work, no one would seek God
* Those who truly seek God's will, shall know the truth of His teaching.
* The Spirit draws unbelievers to Christ
* Conviction may take time but is essential for conversion.

---

## Rationality vs. Warrant in Belief

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **Rationality**: A belief can be rational even if it is false.
  * Example: Believing someone’s name is "Mark" based on their introduction, even if they are lying.
* **Warrant**: A belief is warranted when it is formed by a reliable mechanism and constitutes knowledge.
  * Example: The Holy Spirit’s witness provides warrant for Christian truths.
* Plantinga: The Holy Spirit acts as a reliable belief-forming mechanism, granting warrant to Christian beliefs.

---

## Properly Basic Beliefs and Warrant

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Belief in God and the Gospel is **properly basic**:
  * Grounded in the self-authenticating witness of the Holy Spirit.
  * Does not require external evidence or argument.
* Plantinga: These beliefs are warranted because they are formed in response to God’s self-disclosure.
* Assurance: Christians have genuine knowledge of God’s existence and Gospel truths.

---

## Romans 1:20: Evidence of God in Creation

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;"> For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse. </p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;"> <em>Romans 1:20 (NKJV)</em></p>

* God's Revelation in Nature:
  * Creation reveals God's eternal power and divine nature.
  * Evidence of God is accessible to all through the natural world.
* Accountability:
  * Humanity is "without excuse" for denying God's existence.
  * The witness of creation complements the self-authenticating witness of the Holy Spirit.

---

## The Role of Argument and Evidence

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Arguments and evidence play a **subsidiary role**:
  * **Magisterial use**: Reason judges the Gospel’s truth (illegitimate).
    * Risk: May lead to apostasy if objections cannot be answered.
    * Poor arguments do not excuse unbelief
  * **Ministerial use**: Reason serves the Gospel, supporting faith (legitimate).
* Philosophy as the handmaid of theology:
  * Reason helps understand and defend faith.
  * Faith seeks understanding (St. Anselm).

---

## Dual Warrant for Christian Belief

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Christians can have **dual warrant**:
  * The Holy Spirit’s witness.
  * Arguments from natural theology and Christian evidences.
* Benefits:
  * Increased confidence in Christian truth claims.
  * Greater openness for unbelievers to the Gospel.
  * Support during spiritual dryness or doubt.
* Independent warrant complements the Spirit’s witness, strengthening faith and evangelism.

---

## Faith and Reason in the Christian Life

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Walking by Faith, Not by Sight:
  * Trusting God amidst suffering and unanswered questions.
  * Faith is not blind but supported by the Holy Spirit and natural theology.
* Certainty vs. Knowledge:
  * Certainty is not required for knowledge.
  * Knowledge is grounded in warrant, provided by the Holy Spirit.

---

## Witnessing with Love and Trust in the Holy Spirit

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **Effective Witnessing**:
  * Share faith with love and humility.
  * Trust the Holy Spirit to work in the hearts of others.
* **Overcoming False Testimonies**:
  * The Holy Spirit is more powerful than any false religious experience.
  * Arguments and evidence can shake confidence in false beliefs, opening the way for the Spirit's work.
  * Rejection of Christ is not due to lack of evidence but love of darkness over light.

# Defeaters of Properly Basic Beliefs and Their Rebuttals

---

## Defeaters and Defeater-Rebuttals

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* A **defeater** is a belief or argument that challenges the validity of another belief
  * E.g.: The problem of evil vs belief in God.
* A **Defeater-rebuttal** is a belief or argument that refutes a defeater, making it invalid.
  * Example: Free Will Defense against the problem of evil.
  * The Holy Spirit's witness can intrinsically defeat defeaters.
    * A person framed and falsely accused of a crime knows their innocence despite contrary evidence.
    * Similarly, the Spirit's witness can outweigh arguments against Christianity.

---

## Intrinsic Defeaters

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* An **Intrinsic Defeater** is a belief or experience that inherently overcomes objections without requiring external arguments.
  * The Holy Spirit's witness intrinsically defeats objections.
  * Example:
    * The problem of evil is outweighed by the Spirit's assurance of God's existence.
    * The implanted natural sense of God deepens this assurance.

---

## Refuting False Claims of Religious Experience

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* False claims (e.g., "burning in the bosom") do not undermine genuine experiences.
* Responses to objections:
  * Cognitive faculties forming religious beliefs are not fundamentally unreliable, even if some people arrive at wrong believes
  * My properly grounded basic belief in God is not challenged by some other invalidly claimed basic belief in a false God
  * Converts often report a profound difference in their experience of God.

---

## Refuting False Claims of Neuro Science

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Neuro science can artificially induce religious experiences
  * That does not invalidate genuine ones.
  * Example
    * Hallucinations do not undermine the reliability of normal sensory perception.

---

## The Role of the Holy Spirit's Witness

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* The Holy Spirit's witness can vary in intensity based on circumstances and needs.
  * Example: A student indoctrinated with Marxist propaganda may experience a more intense witness.
* Assurance through the Spirit:
  * The Spirit ensures that no believer is rationally obligated to apostatize.
  * The witness of the Holy Spirit is sufficient for perseverance in faith.

---

## Testing the Spirits

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;"> <em>1 John 4:1 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Context:
  * Refers to false prophets, not the Holy Spirit's witness.
  * The Spirit's witness exceeds human testimony and leads into all truth.
* Assurance:
  * The Spirit's testimony is self-authenticating and unmistakable for the believer.

---

## Rationality and the Self-Authenticating Witness of the Holy Spirit

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Most Christians lack the resources for a full apologetic.
  * Belief in Christ does not require prior apologetic preparation.
  * Example: A seminary student who "knew Jesus" without a developed apologetic.
* The Holy Spirit's witness provides sufficient warrant for belief:
  * It is self-authenticating and cannot be mistaken by those who genuinely experience it.
  * Rational argumentation serves as a confirmation, not a foundation.
* Role of God's Word:
  * The Word provides the content of the Gospel.
  * The Spirit bears witness to the truth of the Word.

---

## Assurance Through the Holy Spirit

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* The Holy Spirit provides a **deep assurance** of the truth of the Gospel.
* This assurance is both **personal** and **unmistakable** for the believer.
* It serves as a foundation for properly basic belief in God and the truths of Christianity.

---

## Practical Implications

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* For believers:
  * Confidence in their faith despite objections.
  * Assurance of salvation and reconciliation with God.
* For unbelievers:
  * Conviction of sin and drawing to Christ.
  * Opportunity to respond to the Spirit's work.
