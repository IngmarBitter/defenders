## Recap: The Mystery of Existence

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Why is there something rather than nothing?
* William Shakespeare (*Hamlet*, Act 3, Scene 1, 1600):
  * "To be, or not to be, that is the question."
* Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716):
  * The universe's existence requires an explanation.
  * The answer lies in a transcendent cause: God.
* Martin Heidegger (1889–1976):
  * "Why are there beings rather than nothing? That is the question."

## Leibniz's Cosmological Argument from Contingency

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

1. The universe is an existing thing.
2. Every existing thing has an explanation of its existence, either in the necessity of its own nature or in an external cause.
3. If the universe has an explanation of its existence, that explanation is God.
4. Therefore, the explanation of the existence of the universe is God.

* This argument is logically airtight:
  * If the premises are true, the conclusion necessarily follows.
  * Denying the conclusion requires rejecting at least one premise.

## Types of Beings: Contingent vs Necessary

![](NatTheoPics/PossibleWorlds.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **Contingent beings**:
  * Exist but could have failed to exist.
  * Require an external cause for their existence.
  * Examples: People, planets, galaxies.
* **Necessary beings**:
  * Exist by the necessity of their own nature.
  * Cannot fail to exist.
  * Examples: Some mathematicians argue numbers or sets are necessary.
  * **Illustration**: The number 1 cannot exist in one possible world but not another.

## The Universe: A Contingent Being

![](NatTheoPics/PossibleWorlds.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* The universe is a contingent being:
  * It could have failed to exist.
  * Its existence requires an explanation.
* Merely increasing the size of the universe does not remove the need for an explanation.

---

## Illustration: The Translucent Ball

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Imagine finding a translucent ball in the forest:
  * You would naturally ask, "Why does it exist?"
  * Increasing its size (to a planet, galaxy, or universe) does not remove the need for an explanation.

---

## The Explanation: A Necessary Being

![](NatTheoPics/PossibleWorlds.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* If God exists, He is a necessary being:
  * Exists by the necessity of His own nature.
  * Cannot be caused by anything else.
  * **Insight**: God's necessity is not based on being beginningless but on the impossibility of His non-existence.
* Leibniz's argument points to a metaphysically necessary being as the ultimate explanation for the universe.

---

## The Implications of the Argument

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* The argument provides a powerful concept of God:
  * A metaphysically necessary being.
  * The ultimate explanation for the universe.
* Challenges skeptics to address the plausibility of the premises.

# Objections to the Argument from Contingency

---

## Premise (1): The Taxicab Fallacy

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Atheists often exempt the universe from the principle of sufficient reason:
  * "Everything in the universe has an explanation, but the universe itself does not."
* Arthur Schopenhauer's critique:
  * The principle of sufficient reason cannot be dismissed like a taxicab once it reaches the universe.
  * Doing so is unscientific.
* Leibniz's consistency:
  * God is not exempt from the principle.
  * His existence needs an explanation, too:
    * His existence is explained by the necessity of His own nature.

---

## The Universe as an Exception

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Some atheists argue the universe exists without explanation because:
  * It is impossible for the universe to have an explanation.
* Response:
  * This assumes atheism is true (circular reasoning).
  * If God exists, the universe's explanation lies in God and His will.

---

## The Universe as a Necessary Being

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Some claim the universe exists necessarily:
  * This is a philosophical claim.
* Response:
  * If the universe were necessary, it would have to exist exactly as it is.
  * However, we can imagine:
    * A universe with no moon or a second moon (a different universe).
    * No universe at all.
  * The universe is composed of contingent parts (e.g., quarks, electrons).
    * A different collection of quarks or particles could have existed.
  * Hence, the universe's existence is not necessary.
  * The universe is contingent.

---

## The Beginning of the Universe

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Evidence suggests the universe had a beginning.
  * A metaphysically necessary being must exist eternally.
  * If the universe began to exist, it cannot be metaphysically necessary.
* The beginning of the universe highlights its contingency:
  * The universe came into being out of nothing.
  * This reinforces the need for an explanation.

---

## Premise (2): The Explanation is God

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* If the universe has an explanation, that explanation is God.
* Logical rule: Contraposition:
  * If it **is** raining, then the road **is** wet.
  * If the road **is not** wet, then it **is not** raining.
* Logical equivalence:
  * If atheism **is true**, the universe **has no** explanation.
  * If the universe **has an** explanation, atheism **is false**.
    * If atheism is false, then God must exist.

---

## The Cause of the Universe

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* The explanation must transcend space, time, matter, and energy:
  * A non-physical, immaterial, timeless, spaceless being.
* Possible candidates:
  * Abstract objects (e.g., numbers): Cannot cause anything.
  * An unembodied mind or consciousness: A personal agent with intellect and will.
* Argument for personhood:
  * A personal agent can freely choose to create a contingent universe.
  * This explains how a necessary cause produces a contingent effect.

---

## Conclusion: The Rich Concept of God

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* The argument from contingency leads to a rich concept of God:
  * Ominpotent
  * Transcends space, time, and matter.
  * Exists with metaphysical necessity.
  * An uncaused, unembodied mind.
  * Conscious, Selfaware, Personal
* This is an exalted and theologically significant conclusion — mind-blowing.

## Leibniz's Cosmological Argument Summary

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

1. The universe is an existing thing.
2. Every existing thing has an explanation of its existence, either in the necessity of its own nature or in an external cause.
3. If the universe has an explanation of its existence, that explanation is God.
4. Therefore, the explanation of the existence of the universe is God.

   * Sound & Valid Logical Argument
   * God must be: Immaterial, Uncaused, Necessary, Omnipotent, Unembodied Mind, Conscious, Selfaware, Personal
