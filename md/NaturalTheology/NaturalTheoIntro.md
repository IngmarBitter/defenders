## What is Natural Theology?

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Explores justification of Christianity's truth claims **apart from authoritative divine revelation**
* Seeks warrant for Christian beliefs without appealing to inspired Scripture as authority
* Scripture may be used as historical documents, but not as revelation
* Asks: What can we know about God from reason and the created order?

## Natural Theology vs. General Revelation

![](NatTheoPics/GodFingerprint.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **General revelation**: God's self-disclosure in nature and conscience
  * Like fingerprints of the potter in the clay
* **Natural theology**: human reflection on general revelation
  * Like human assessment of the fingerprints in the clay
  * Arguments are human constructs, not divinely given
  * You are free to disagree with any argument presented
  * Fallible and evolving — each generation refines them
    * Maybe we can improve them?

---

## The Renaissance of Natural Theology

![](NatTheoPics/BookThink.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Recent decades: renewed interest in natural theology in philosophy
* Example: *Blackwell Companion to Natural Theology* — advanced essays on arguments for God
* Many arguments exist; we will focus on five key ones
  * Kalam, Leibnits, Fine Tuning, Moral, Ontology

---

## The Cumulative Case Approach

![](NatTheoPics/ChainMail.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Don't rely on a single argument — think **cumulative case**
* Each argument reinforces the others
* Analogy: not a chain (weakest link fails), but chain mail (links reinforce each other)
* Even weak arguments can contribute to a strong overall case

---

## Arguments in Isolation and Together

![](NatTheoPics/Arguments.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* If each argument is good alone, the cumulative case is even stronger
* Example: DNA evidence, eyewitnesses, and video — each strong, together overwhelming
* We'll examine arguments both individually and as a whole

---

## What is an Argument?

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral1.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* A heated discussion about a disagreement?
  * No!   … a (philosophical) argument is …
* A rational explanation for a truth claim
  * Inference to the Best Explanation
  * Or a deductive argument based on premises
  * Leading to a conclusion via rules of logic
    * Example:
      * Premise 1: If it is raining, then the road is wet.
      * Premise 2: It is raining.
      * Conclusion: Therefore the road is wet.

---

## Deductive Arguments

![](NatTheoPics/Logic.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* A deductive argument is
  * Based on clear premises
  * Leading to a conclusion via rules of logic
* Advantages:
  * Makes the conclusion unavoidable if premises are true
  * Encourages rational belief in the premises
  * Simple to grasp and memorize
  * Easy to discuss — ask which premise is rejected and why

---

## What is a *Bad* Argument?

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral2.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* An argument from ignorance / lack of knowledge
  * Example
    1) God can do anything
    2) I have no idea what causes lightning
    3) Therefore God did it
* A circular logic argument
  * Example
    * God exists because the Bible said so
    * The Bible is true because God said so

---

## What Makes a *Good* Argument?

![](NatTheoPics/GoodArgument.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **Sound**: premises are true
* **Warranted**: premises have evidence or justification
* **Knowledge based**: An argument from knowledge
* **Logically valid**: conclusion follows from premises
  * Makes the conclusion unavoidable
  * Each premise more likely true than its negation
  * Makes believing premises rational
  * Together makes the conclusion rational to believe

---

## How Much Evidence is Needed?

![](NatTheoPics/EvidenceScales.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Controversial: How strong must the evidence for premises be?
* Some say: enough to **permit** belief
* Others (like Craig): evidence should make premises **more plausible than their negations**
* Example: Kalam cosmological argument
  1. Whatever begins to exist has a cause.
  2. The universe began to exist.
  3. Therefore, the universe has a cause.
* The first premise is nearly certain; focus is on plausibility of the second

---

## Good Argument Summary

![](NatTheoPics/ScaleGoodArgument.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* ***Good Premises***
  * **Sound**: are true.
  * **Warranted**: common sense test, more plausible than negation.
  * **Clear**: succinct and understandable.
* ***Good Conclusion***
  * **Logically Valid**: follows logically from premises.
  * **Meaningful**: provides a significant and non-trivial insight.
* **Impact**
  * Conclusion can be denied only if a premise is false.
