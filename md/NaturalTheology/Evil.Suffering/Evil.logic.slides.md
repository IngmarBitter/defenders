## Types of Evil and Our Experience

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Types of evil and suffering
  - Moral evil: results from free agents
    - (e.g., cruelty, injustice)
  - Natural evil: results from nature
    - (e.g., disease, disasters)
- Share
  - Where have you encountered moral or natural evil?
  - What questions did it raise?

## The Problem of Evil: Two Versions

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Intellectual problem
  - "A good God would not allow evil and suffering"
    - Strongest argument for Atheism (still fails)
  - Logical version
    - "God and suffering are logically incompatible"
  - Probabilistic version
    - "Given the suffering we observe, God’s existence is improbable"
- Emotional problem
  - How can we live with the evil and suffering in and around us?

---

## Keep Intellectual and Emotional Distinct

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Intellectual
  - Philosophical analysis
- Emotional
  - Pastoral care and comfort
- If conflated or mismatched:
  - Good intellectual answers can sound cold to the suffering
  - Pastoral responses can feel shallow in abstract debate
- Focus now: Intellectual

## Burden of Proof

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- “A good God would not allow evil and suffering.”
  - This is a slogan, not yet an argument.
- Burden rule: Whoever makes a claim bears the burden of proof.
  - “Explain why God allows it; if you can’t, God does not exist” improperly shifts the burden.
- Require an argument: Turn the slogan into premises that lead to “therefore, God does not exist.”
  - Two attempts: the logical version and the probabilistic version.
- Our task: assess those arguments, not explain every instance of suffering

---

## Logical Version Argument

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

1. God is all-loving and all-powerful
2. Evil and Suffering exists
3. => alleged logical contradiction
4. => God is not both, all-loving and all-powerful
5. => The Christian God does not exist

- Definitions:
  - All-powerful: can do all that’s logically possible
  - All-loving: wills the good of creatures

---

## Logical Argument Worst-Case Assessment

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- If the argument was sound: God does not exist
- On atheism:
  - No objective standard for “good/evil,” “cruelty,” or “injustice”
  - These reduce to preferences, social constructs, or evolutionary byproducts, but no actual evil
- About suffering:
  - Not “evil” or “unintended” by design; nature is indifferent and pain is ubiquitous
  - Brute facts of life; no ultimate justice, redemption, or hope it will get better
- => The “problem of evil” is not solved; is an existential problem for all of us

---

## Logical Argument Assessment

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

1. An all-loving, all-powerful God exists
2. Evil and Suffering exists
<!-- list break -->

<ul>
  <li>- No explicit contradiction</li>
  <li>- Hidden assumptions must be implied</li>
</ul>

---

## Hidden Assumptions Proposed

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

1. An all-loving, all-powerful God exists
2. Evil and Suffering exists
3. An all-powerful God can create any world He wants
4. An all-loving God prefers a world without suffering
<!-- list break -->

<ul>
  <li>- From (3) and (4): If God exists, He both can and would create a world without suffering</li>
  <li>- With (1): “An all-loving, all-powerful God exists” ⇒ God would create a no‑suffering world</li>
  <li>- But (2): “Evil and Suffering exists”</li>
  <li>- Therefore: contradiction between (1)+(3)+(4) and (2)</li>
</ul>

---

## Assessing Assumption (3) All Powerful

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Omnipotence does not include logical impossibilities
- Freedom of the will matters:
  - It’s incoherent to force free choices occur
  - Some worlds are not “creatable” if agents wouldn’t freely cooperate

- If free agents exist:
  - God cannot guarantee specific free outcomes
- Thus (3) is not necessarily true
- Logical version fails here

---

## Assessing Assumption (4) All Loving

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- All-loving God may allow suffering for greater goods
- Common-sense analogies (e.g., dentist, discipline)
- With genuine freedom, some goods require pain or suffering

- Moral growth/virtue require free cooperation
- Creating a world with some suffering may be more loving overall
- Thus (4) is not necessarily true

---

## A Plausible Consistency Statement

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- God could not have created a world with as much good as the actual world but with less suffering, and God has good reasons for permitting the suffering that exists.

- If possibly true, no inconsistency follows

- Heavy burden on atheist: show impossibility
- Contemporary consensus:
  - Logical version widely judged unsuccessful

---

## Probabilistic Version Argument

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

1. If God exists, gratuitous (pointless) suffering would not exist.
2. Gratuitous suffering probably exists.
3. Therefore, probably God does not exist.
<!-- list break -->

- “Gratuitous” = suffering for which there is no morally sufficient reason to permit

---

## Response 1: Our Cognitive Limits (with illustrations)

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- We’re finite in time, space, knowledge; God’s providence spans history
- Not an appeal to mystery/divine psychology; it’s our inherent cognitive limits
- Only an all-knowing God can grasp directing free agents across history (e.g., Allied victory on D‑Day)
- Illustrations
  - Chaos sensitivity: tiny initial changes (e.g., butterfly) can have massive downstream effects (weather, populations)
  - “Sliding Doors”: trivial events alter life trajectories; appearance ≠ reality regarding purpose
  - Utilitarianism critique: we cannot forecast ultimate outcomes; short-term bad may enable long-term good
- Therefore: “looks pointless” does not justify “is pointless” (probabilistic force diminishes)

---

## Response 2: Probabilities Are Relative (setup)

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Probabilities are always relative to background information
  - Example: “Joe is a college student; 90% drink beer” ⇒ probably drinks
  - Add: “Joe is a Wheaton student; 90% there don’t drink” ⇒ probably does not drink
- Not interesting: P(God | suffering alone)
- Relevant: P(God | full scope of evidence)
- Many discussions tacitly assume “nothing else on the other side of the scale”

---

## Response 2b: Full Scope and the Moral Argument

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Even if P(God | suffering) is low, the cumulative case can outweigh it
- The moral argument from evil:
  1. If God does not exist, objective moral values do not exist
  2. Evil exists
  3. Therefore objective moral values exist
  4. Therefore God exists
- Paradox: at a deeper level, “evil” presupposes an objective moral standard

---

## Response 3: Christian Doctrines that Raise Co‑existence Probability

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Four doctrines:
  1) Life’s chief end is knowledge of God, not earthly comfort
  2) Human rebellion; God “gives them up” (Rom 1)
  3) Eternal life reframes finite suffering (2 Cor 4)
  4) Knowing God is an incommensurable good (“weight of glory”)

---

## Empirical Corroboration (Operation World; snapshots)

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- China: Cultural Revolution persecution; post‑1977 massive church growth (tens of millions to ~90–100M)
- El Salvador: war/poverty; from ~2.3% evangelicals (1960) to ~20% (1990s)
- Ethiopia: repression/famine/war; from <1% (1960) to ~13% (1990)
- Global trend: ratio of evangelicals to non‑believers shrinks across history; unprecedented in‑gathering

---

## Doctrine 2: Human Rebellion

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Moral evils unsurprising on Christian view
- Romans 1: God “gave them up”
- God permits human depravity to run its course

---

## Doctrine 3: Eternal Perspective

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- This life: foyer to eternity
- Paul’s “slight momentary afflictions” (2 Cor 4)
- Infinite future overwhelms finite present suffering

---

## Doctrine 4: Incommensurable Good

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Knowing God outweighs any temporal suffering
- “Weight of glory” beyond comparison
- Grounds to say “God is good” even amid pain

---

## Burden of Proof (Revisited)

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- The claim is: “God is improbable given suffering”
- Response: Not the Christian God
  - The atheist must either:
    - Show these four doctrines are probably false, or
    - Show God remains improbable even if these doctrines are true
- Don’t let the burden shift back to the theist

---

## Summary: Intellectual Assessment

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Logical version: fails (incompatibility unproven)
- Probabilistic version: weak
  - Cognitive limits
  - Full evidence raises P(God)
  - Christian doctrines increase co‑existence probability

---

## Emotional Problem Remains

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Intellectually defused ≠ emotionally resolved
- Responses: presence, compassion, hope
- Head and heart both matter

---

## Discussion

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Which version do you encounter most?
- Where do people feel the weight emotionally?
- How can we care well while thinking clearly?
