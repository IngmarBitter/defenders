## Why?

![](EvilPics/woman.crying.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

God sometimes ...

* let Satan inflict suffering to proove a point 
  - Job  
* struck people dead immediately after sinning 
  - Ananias & Sapphira, Acts 5:1-11
* ... or after many generations of sinning 
  - Sodom & Gomorrah, Genesis  
* inflicted disease as punisment for the Philistines capturing the ark of God 
  - 1 Samuel 5

## Why Me?

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    But you, O Lord, are a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;"> <em>Psalm 86:15 (NKJV)</em></p>

* God punishing sin quickly is the exception, not the rule
* God typically does not give an explanation why it did happen
* Feelings of hurt, anger, confusion are normal and valid

## Jesus comforted and healed

* Jesus had dinner at the home of rejected men
* Wept with the mourners for Lazarus
* Healed the sick
* Sacrificed and suffered for the ones he loved

## Jesus told us

![](EvilPics/jesus.dove.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

* He sent us the Holy Spirit
  - to comfort and guide us
  - to give us strength

* He commanded us to be his hands and feet
  - to be the ones that comfort others
  - ... the ones that heal and give strength

## Suffering prepares us

When we suffer the best help is ...

* from people that have made it through the same suffering
  - that have learned to overcome or cope with it
  - that can tell from experience that there is hope

Suffering gets us ready to =>

* help others in the future
* become Jesus hands and feet
* act upon Jesus's behalf

## Practical Responses — What to say

![](EvilPics/Comfort.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- "I am so sorry this happened to you."
- "I don't have all the answers, but I'm here with you."
- "It's okay to feel angry, sad, or confused."
- Offer immediate help: calls, meals, errands, prayer if welcome.

## Practical Responses — What to do

![](EvilPics/Comfort.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Listen closely; ask gentle questions.
- Provide concrete assistance (meals, childcare, appointments).
- Connect to trusted community and professional help (counselors, grief groups).
- Follow up regularly—presence matters more than perfect words.

## Practical Responses — What not to do

![](EvilPics/Listen.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Avoid saying "God did this to teach you" or giving quick doctrinal answers.
- Prioritize lament, presence, and care over abstract apologetics.
- When the person asks for theological discussion, engage gently and briefly.
