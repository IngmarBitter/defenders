## Why Consider Atheistic Arguments?

![](NatTheoPics/Arguments.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Goal: assess where the balance of evidence lies
* Common refrain: “There’s no evidence God exists”
* Practical response:
  * Share multiple arguments concisely
  * Invite engagement: “Which premise do you reject, and why?”
  * Stay focused on premises; avoid distractions

---

## Epistemological Objection 1: Verificationism

![](NatTheoPics/Logic.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Claim: only empirically verifiable statements are meaningful
* Problems:
  * Too restrictive (would undercut math, logic, much of science)
  * Self-refuting (the principle itself isn’t empirically verifiable)
* Result: long abandoned by philosophers of science and knowledge

---

## “Presumption of Atheism” I: Redefinition

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral1.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Move: redefine atheism as “just lack of belief”
* Issues:
  * Becomes a psychological state, not a truth-claim
  * Babies and pets would count as atheists—absurd result
* Core question remains: does God exist? That claim needs reasons

---

## “Presumption of Atheism” II: Universal Negatives

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral2.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* “You can’t prove a universal negative” (e.g., “no God”)
* Response:
  * Some universal negatives are provable (e.g., contradictions)
  * If atheism were unprovable by principle, that’s a liability for atheism, not a pass
    * It concedes the atheist’s global denial cannot, even in principle, be supported by evidence or argument, making it irrational to affirm while theism remains evidentially assessable

## Absence of Evidence ≠ Evidence of Absence

![](NatTheoPics/ScaleGoodArgument.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

When does absence of evidence count as evidence of absence?

1. We have carefully studied all purported lines of evidence in detail
2. If the entity existed, we should expect more evidence than we have

Application to theism:

1. Requires careful, in-depth review of natural-theology arguments
2. “If God existed, there’d be more evidence” is not obvious, i.e. what more?

## The Hiddenness of God

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral3.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Claim: if God existed, His existence would be starkly obvious
* Reply:
  * Aim is transformative relationship, not mere acknowledgment
  * James 2:19 (NKJV): “Even the demons believe—and tremble!”
  * Luke 16:31 (NKJV): “If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one rise from the dead.”
* Mere spectacle doesn’t ensure love or repentance

---

## Why Not Neon-in-the-Sky Proof?

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* God seeks freely given love; coercive signs can harden hearts
* The Spirit uses evidence, preaching, and conscience to draw persons
* God being more obvious would likely yield fewer freely loving responses

---

## Summary

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral5.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* “No evidence” claims ignore substantial theistic arguments
* Verificationism fails; presumption-of-atheism moves are weak
* Hiddenness doesn’t show improbability of God
