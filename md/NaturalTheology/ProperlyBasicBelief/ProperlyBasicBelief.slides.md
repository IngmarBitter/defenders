## Properly Basic Belief: Introduction

![](NatTheoPics/Plantinga.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Not really an argument for God's existence
* Claim: You can know God exists **apart from arguments**
* Still part of natural theology—belief in God can be rational and warranted by natural reason, without argument
* Chief proponent: Alvin Plantinga (Book: *Warranted Christian Belief*)

## Plantinga and Reformed Epistemology

![](NatTheoPics/BeliefReasons.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Plantinga: belief in God can be **warranted** apart from arguments
* Arguments are sufficient but not necessary for rational belief
* This is called **Reformed Epistemology** (after John Calvin)

## Properly Basic Beliefs

![](NatTheoPics/matrix.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Some beliefs are rational to hold without argument — **properly basic**
* Examples:
  * Reality of the past
  * Existence of the external world - no matrix
  * Presence of other minds - not just AI
* These cannot be proved by argument, but are foundational to our thinking

## Properly Basic Beliefs Are Grounded

![](NatTheoPics/matrix.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Properly basic beliefs are not arbitrary — they are **appropriately grounded** in experience
* Example: Sensing the world around you grounds belief in its reality
* You are rational to accept these beliefs unless given a good reason (defeater) not to

## Discussion: Illusion and Proper Basicality

![](NatTheoPics/budda.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* How to respond to someone who claims the world is an illusion (e.g., Buddhist or Hindu)?
  * You don't try to argue for the external world — it's properly basic
  * Burden is on the skeptic to provide a defeater
* Even those who claim the world is illusion live as if it is real
  * Pure illusions would not plan for the future

## Can Atheism Be Properly Basic?

![](NatTheoPics/MatrixNoGod.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Could an atheist claim atheism is properly basic?
  * Difficult: what experience would ground belief in God's nonexistence?
  * Theist can appeal to the witness of the Holy Spirit
  * Atheist lacks a comparable grounding mechanism
  * Absense of evidence is not evidence for absense
    * Elephant vs ant in room?
    * Spagetty monster vs immaterial God in room?

## Belief in God Is Appropriately Grounded

![](NatTheoPics/Experience.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* In the Bible, God is known as an **experienced reality**, not an inferred idea
* Prof John Hick: God was "a sheer given reality" to biblical people
* Belief in God is grounded in the **experience of God** — the witness of the Holy Spirit

## Next Steps

![](NatTheoPics/innerWitness.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Next: Explore the **inner witness of the Holy Spirit**
* How this warrants belief in God for both believers and unbelievers
* Also: How to handle defeaters for belief in God
