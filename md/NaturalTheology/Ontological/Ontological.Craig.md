# The Ontological Argument

In our excursus on natural theology we’ve talked about a number of arguments for God’s existence such as the argument from contingency, the kalam cosmological argument, the argument from the fine-tuning of the universe, the argument from the applicability of mathematics, and the moral argument. Today we turn to a new argument (and the last that we’ll be surveying in our class), and this is the ontological argument for God’s existence.

In the year 1078 a Benedictine monk by the name of Anselm, who later became the Archbishop of Canterbury, formulated a new and bold argument for the existence of God which has now fascinated philosophers for nearly a millennium. A year earlier in 1077 Anselm had finished writing a treatise called the Monologium in which he presented cosmological and moral arguments for God’s existence. But Anselm was dissatisfied with the complexity of the case for theism that he had developed, and he wanted to find a single argument which would prove that God with all of his attributes, in all of his greatness, exists. He had pretty much given up on the task when he came upon the definition of “God” as (in Latin) aliquid quo nihil maius cogitari potest. The Latin is so great. You can learn this phrase and impress your friends when they ask you for a definition of God! God is something than which nothing greater can be conceived, or, in more idiomatic English, God is the greatest conceivable being.

Anselm argued in his treatise that followed – the Proslogium - that once you understand the definition of God, once you understand what God is, then (if you’ve really understood it) you will see that God must exist because if God did not exist he would not be the greatest conceivable being. A greatest conceivable being must be an existent being. Otherwise it wouldn’t be the greatest. So God’s existence is inconceivable for anybody who really understands the word “God” and understands what God is.

Anselm says that’s why Psalm 14:1 says, “The fool has said in his heart there is no God” – because if that person really understood the word “God,” then he would see that God must exist. So he is a fool for saying that the greatest conceivable being does not exist.

Anselm’s argument came to be known as the ontological argument, which is from the Greek word ontos, meaning “being.” It went on to assume a variety of different forms and has been defended by some of the greatest thinkers in the history of philosophy, for example, John Duns Scotus, Rene Descartes, Benedict de Spinoza, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, and so on.

What is the common thread in all of these different versions of the argument that unites them and makes them ontological arguments? I think the common thread among these various ontological arguments is that they all try to deduce the existence of God from the very concept of God, together with some necessary truths. Proponents of the ontological argument in its various forms maintain that once we understand what God is (once you have an adequate conception of God – whether the greatest conceivable being, or the most perfect being, or the most real being) then we will see that such a being must in fact exist.

This argument has tended to sharply polarize philosophers. For example, the 19th century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer characterized the ontological argument as “a charming joke.” That opinion is certainly shared by many other philosophers today. On the other hand, the argument has been taken very seriously and in fact defended as sound by quite a number of 20th century philosophers who are of some prominence as well, notably Norman Malcolm, Charles Hartshorne, and Alvin Plantinga.

Since Plantinga’s version of the argument is, I think, the most sophisticated and the most recent development of the argument, we’ll use it as the springboard for our discussion of the ontological argument. In Plantinga’s version of the argument he appropriates the insight of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz that the ontological argument assumes that the concept of God is possible. That is to say, the argument assumes that the concept “God” or “the greatest conceivable being” is a coherent concept. Or, using the semantics of possible worlds, it assumes that there is a possible world in which God exists.

For those who are unfamiliar with the semantics of possible worlds, let me just say a word of explanation about this, lest we be misled. When we talk about possible worlds, we do not mean planets or even other universes. Rather, a possible world is simply a maximal description of reality. It is a way reality might be. I think the easiest way to think about a possible world is as a huge conjunction of propositions – p and q and r and s and so on, that are mutually consistent. These individual conjuncts (p, q, r, s) are propositions which can be true or false. A possible world is a consistent conjunction which comprises every proposition or its contradictory so that it yields a maximal description of reality. Nothing is left out of such a description. By negating different conjuncts or propositions we can arrive at different possible worlds. So, for example, we could call W1 this description of the world:

W1 = p & q & r & s . . .

But other descriptions of the world could be:

W2 = p & not-q & r & not-s . . .

W3 = not-p & q & not-r & s . . .

W4 = not-p & not-q & r & not-s . . .

And so on.

Only one of these descriptions will be comprised of propositions or conjuncts all of which are true and so is the true description of the way reality actually is. That description we will dignify by saying it is the actual world. One of these will have all true conjuncts, and that will be the actual world.

When we talk about possible worlds, these propositions making up these various conjunctions need to be not only compossible (that is to say, be possible together) but each proposition individually needs to be possible as well. For example, take the proposition, “The prime minister is a prime number.” That proposition isn’t even possibly true. The prime minister is a concrete object – a flesh and blood human being. Therefore it is impossible that he could have been a prime number. That means that no possible world will include that statement as one of its conjuncts because it is impossible. That will be false in every possible world. It is necessarily false. So a proposition which is necessarily false will be one that is false in every possible world.

By contrast, the proposition, “George McGovern is the President of the United States” is false in the actual world. But there are possible worlds in which it is true. McGovern could have been elected President of the United States. So that is a possible proposition, and it will be a conjunct in some possible worlds. To say that McGovern is the President of the United States in some possible world is simply to say that there is a maximal description of reality that has that relevant proposition as one of its conjuncts. That isn’t the actual world. That would be a non-actual possible world – a possible world which isn’t actual, one in which that conjunct is true.

Leibniz’s insight into the ontological argument is that the argument assumes that the proposition “God exists” or “A greatest conceivable being exists” or “A perfect being exists” is possibly true. That is to say that God exists in some possible world. In some possible world that statement, that conjunct – “God exists” or “A maximally great being exists” or “A perfect being exists” – that proposition is true in some possible world.

If the concept of God is incoherent or impossible, then God would be like that prime minister that is a prime number. It would be a metaphysical impossibility. He would not exist in any possible world. The word “God” in that case would refer to nothing, no more than the words “a square circle” refers to something. In both cases the words “A greatest conceivable being” or “a square circle” would just be an incoherent combination of words. They don’t refer to anything. As Leibniz says, the ontological argument assumes that the concept of God is a coherent concept – it is possible for God to exist.

In his version of the argument, Alvin Plantinga conceives of God as a being which is maximally excellent in every possible world. What does he mean by that? By maximal excellence, Plantinga takes this to entail such excellent-making properties as being all-knowing, all-powerful, and all-good. A being which has those properties will be more excellent than a being which is limited in knowledge or strength or goodness. So a maximally excellent being will be one that has omnipotence, omniscience, and moral perfection.

A being which has maximal excellence in every possible world has what Plantinga calls maximal greatness. There is a difference between maximal greatness and maximal excellence. Maximal excellence is the property of being all-knowing, all-powerful, all-good. Maximal greatness is the property of having maximal excellence in every possible world.

Now, Plantinga says, the property of maximal greatness is possibly exemplified. That is to say, this is a coherent concept. There is a possible world in which a maximally great being exists. But if a maximally great being exists in one possible world, it exists in all of them, including the actual world. Therefore, God exists.

We can formulate Plantinga’s version of the ontological argument as follows:

1. It is possible that a maximally great being exists.

2. If it is possible that a maximally great being exists, then a maximally great being exists in some possible world.

3. If a maximally great being exists in some possible world, then it exists in every possible world.

4. If a maximally great being exists in every possible world, then it exists in the actual world.

5. If a maximally great being exists in the actual world, then a maximally great being exists.

6. Therefore, a maximally great being exists.

Although Plantinga thinks that the ontological argument is a sound and non-question begging argument for God’s existence, initially at least he did not regard it as a “successful piece of natural theology.” Why not? Why isn’t this a successful piece of natural theology? He said it is because the key premise, “It is possible that a maximally great being exists” can be rationally denied.

But Plantinga later confessed that he had set the bar for “success in natural theology” unreasonably high. This is what he later came to say,

I employed a traditional but wholly improper standard: I took it that these arguments are successful only if they start from propositions that compel assent from every honest and intelligent person and proceed majestically to their conclusion by way of forms of argument that can be rejected only on pain of insincerity or irrationality. Naturally enough, I joined the contemporary chorus in holding that none of the traditional arguments was successful. (I failed to note that no philosophical arguments of any consequence meet that standard; hence the fact that theistic arguments do not is of less significance than I thought.)[1]

So Plantinga says he initially thought that in order to be a successful piece of natural theology the arguments had to compel assent from any rational person. He came to see that if you hold that standard, then there are no good philosophical arguments for anything. Plantinga now believes, “The ontological argument provides as good grounds for the existence of God as does any serious philosophical argument for any important philosophical conclusion.”[2] George Mavrodes, who was a professor of philosophy at the University of Western Michigan, rightly remarked on Plantinga’s assessment, “But if natural theology can be that good, as good as the best arguments anywhere in serious philosophy, . . . why should we not put forward these powerful arguments as proofs of God?”[3]

You might be surprised to learn that premises (2) through (5) of this argument are relatively uncontroversial. The real point of contention is premise (1) – that it is possible that a maximally great being exists. This is the principal question which needs to be settled with regard to Plantinga’s version of the ontological argument. What warrant exists for thinking that this key premise “It is possible that a maximally great being exists” is true?

In dealing with this issue it is very important that we keep firmly in mind the difference between what we could call epistemic possibility and metaphysical possibility. “Epistemic” derives from the Greek word episteme or “knowledge.” Epistemic possibility indicates what is possible with respect to your knowledge. So, in response to the ontological argument’s key premise, one is tempted to say, “Well, it is possible that God exists, and it’s possible that God does not exist.” That is true only with respect to epistemic possibility. What you are saying there is: “For all I know, God exists or he doesn’t exist. It is possible with respect to what I know. It is epistemically possible. I don’t know which is right. For all I know, God may or may not exist.”

But metaphysical possibility has to do with what is actualizable or what can be real independently of what you think about it. If God is a maximally great being, then his existence, if it is metaphysically possible, will be metaphysically necessary. It will not be true to say it is possible that God exists or it is possible that he doesn’t. That would be to say that God exists in some possible worlds, but he doesn’t exist in other possible worlds. That would be incorrect. The concept of a maximally great being is such that it either exists in all possible worlds or it exists in none of them. But you can’t say it exists in some of them and does not exist in others of them.

Let me give an illustration of this difference between epistemic possibility and metaphysical possibility that will help to make the point clear.

There is a mathematical proposition known as Goldbach’s Conjecture that remains unproven in mathematics today. Goldbach’s Conjecture says that every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. So take any even number greater than 2, like 10 – that will be equal to the sum of two prime numbers, in this case 7 and 3. Although Goldbach’s Conjecture has been tested to enormous lengths, no mathematician has ever been able to prove it or disprove it. We don’t know whether Goldbach’s Conjecture is true or not. So in this epistemic sense one can say (epistemically) Goldbach’s Conjecture could be true or it could be false. We just don’t know which. But as a piece of mathematics, Goldbach’s Conjecture is either necessarily true or necessarily false. It is either necessary that Goldbach’s Conjecture is true or it is impossible that it is true. It cannot possibly be true and possibly be false in this metaphysical sense. It is either impossible or necessary. One or the other. But it cannot be both possibly true and possibly false. It is necessarily true or necessarily false.

In the same way, although the key premise of the ontological argument could be epistemically uncertain – we don’t know whether it is possible that a maximally great being exists or not – nevertheless, the epistemic entertainability of the key premise or of the denial of the key premise doesn’t guarantee that either is metaphysically possible.

The question we are asking here is: is it metaphysically possible that a maximally great being exists? Not is it epistemically possible, which I think it certainly is. But is it metaphysically possible?

Think about it – the concept of a maximally great being seems intuitively-speaking a coherent idea and therefore possibly instantiated. The idea of a being which is all-knowing, all-powerful, all-good in every possible world seems to be a perfectly coherent idea and therefore possibly instantiated. In order for the ontological argument to fail, the concept of a maximally great being would have to be logically incoherent. It would need to be like the concept of a married bachelor. The concept of a married bachelor, when you think about it, is not a strictly or explicitly self-contradictory concept as would be, say, the concept of a married unmarried man. That would be strictly contradictory. But nevertheless once you understand the concept or the meaning of what a bachelor is you can see that it is impossible that there could be something corresponding to that concept – that that concept could be possibly exemplified or that property possibly instantiated. By contrast to that, the concept of a maximally great being doesn’t seem at all incoherent. Quite the contrary, it seems perfectly coherent to talk about a being which is maximally excellent in every possible world. That would go some distance, I think, to warrant the first premise that it is possible that a maximally great being exists.

## Objections to the Ontological Argument

Some of you might be thinking, “But doesn’t this lead to a kind of ontological overkill?” One of the most important strategies that detractors of the ontological argument adopt is to provide parodies of the ontological argument that would lead to all sorts of absurdities that nobody would think exists. These go back to Anselm’s fellow monk Guanilo. You remember Anselm was asking the question, “Why does the Scripture say ‘the fool hath said in his heart there is no God?’” Why does the Scripture call the atheist a fool? Anselm’s answer was that once you properly understand the concept or the word “God” you can see that God must exist. Therefore the fool is saying something incoherent in saying God does not exist. Guanilo, his fellow monk, wrote a treatise called On Behalf of the Fool in which he criticized Anselm’s argument. The way he did so was to construct parodies of the argument where you would try to construct parallel ontological arguments for absurd conclusions. For example, it has been suggested that you could prove that a most-perfect island exists in this way by saying a most-perfect island must have all of these great-making properties in every possible world, and that is possible, therefore that a most-perfect island actually exists. Or a necessarily existent lion – a lion that has the property of necessary existence would exist in every possible world, and therefore there must be a necessarily existent lion. Those seem to be coherent concepts, and yet they would lead to the postulation of entities which nobody would accept. In my debates on the existence of God, some of my opponents have suggested, for example, the idea of a necessarily existent pizza or a most-perfect pizza would be one that exists in every possible world. Therefore if the ontological argument is sound, we should believe in the existence of the most-perfect pizza or necessarily existent pizza.

What might the defender of the ontological argument say in response to these parodies? Quite a bit, I think. I think that the proponent of the ontological argument can plausibly claim that the concept of God differs from these supposedly parallel concepts like a most-perfect island or a necessarily existent lion or necessarily existent pizza.

1. The properties that go to make up maximal excellence that Plantinga talks about have intrinsic maximum values. For example, omniscience is the property of knowing only and all truths. You can’t get any more knowing than that! So there is an intrinsic inherent ceiling on the property of omniscience. Similarly for the other properties like moral perfection and omnipotence. But that is not the case with things like islands. Islands don’t have intrinsic maximal properties. As Plantinga says, there could always be more palm trees and native dancing girls to improve the island. It really is incoherent to talk about a most-perfect island in a way that it isn’t incoherent to talk about a maximally great being.

2. It is far from clear that there really are objective excellent-making properties of things like islands. Are there really objective properties that go to make up the excellence of islands? It seems not. That is a very subjective thing dependent upon your personal preference. Do you prefer a desert island or one that is crowded with the finest resort hotels? It depends on your tastes which one of these you think is the better island. So there really aren’t objective excellent-making properties that go into islands in the way that omniscience, omnipotence, and goodness seem to be objective great-making properties. With respect to the parody of the island, there are two problems – the lack of intrinsic maximum values and the lack of the objectivity of there even being excellent-making properties of islands.

As for the idea of something like a necessarily existent lion or a necessarily existent pizza, this also is incoherent. For as a necessary being, such an animal would have to exist in every possible world that we can conceive. But any animal which would exist in a possible world in which the universe is comprised of a single, infinitely dense, space-time singularity just is not a lion. That is not what you mean by a lion. Similarly, it is not a pizza either. By contrast, a maximally excellent being could be immaterial and therefore transcend the physical limitations of space and time and so could be necessarily existent. It could exist in a possible world in which the universe is a space-time singularity. Lest you think that a pizza, say, could be immaterial – though that wouldn’t be very satisfying, would it?-- a pizza is something that you can eat, and you can’t eat an immaterial object. Again, the idea of a necessarily existent pizza or necessarily existent lion upon closer reflection really does turn out to be incoherent and therefore doesn’t exist in other possible worlds.

Perhaps the greatest challenge to the appeal to our intuitions to justify premise (1) would be to say that it is intuitively coherent in exactly the same way to conceive of what we might call a quasi-maximally great being. That is to say, a being which is in every other respect maximally excellent except that in one of those excellent-making properties it is a little deficient. For example, imagine a being which is morally perfect and omnipotent, but it is not quite omniscient because it doesn’t know future contingents. It is, in fact, the God of open theism, who knows all past and present true propositions but doesn’t know the truth value of future tense propositions about contingent events. Why is the premise of the ontological argument more plausible than a parallel argument that says it is possible that a quasi-maximally great being exists? If we are warranted in thinking that a maximally great being exists, wouldn’t we be equally warranted in thinking that it is possible that a quasi-maximally great being exists? If you think that, then you’ve got to think that such a being does exist. It wouldn’t deny the existence of God per se, but it would mean that in addition to the maximally great being you are going to populate your world with all sorts of quasi-maximally great beings. That would surely be implausible and undesirable.

If the key premise of the ontological argument is true, isn’t it also true that it is possible that a quasi-maximally great being exists? I am not so sure. I think not because maximal greatness, I want to argue, is logically incompatible with quasi-maximal greatness. Think about it. A maximally great being is by definition an omnipotent being. It is all-powerful. That is part of what goes to make up maximal greatness. So no concrete object could exist independently of its creative power. As an omnipotent being, a maximally great being would have to have the power to freely refrain from creating anything at all. Therefore, there must be possible worlds in which nothing but the maximally great being exists. But that entails that if maximal greatness is possibly exemplified then quasi-maximal greatness is not. There might be quasi-excellent beings in many worlds – worlds in which the maximally great being has chosen to create quasi-excellent beings. Maybe they would be like angels that would be supernatural, superhuman, but not like God. But those beings would lack necessary existence. They would be created by the maximally great being, and therefore they would not be quasi-maximally great. They could be quasi-excellent, but they wouldn’t be quasi-maximally great because they wouldn’t exist in every possible world. So if maximal greatness is possibly exemplified, which I think is intuitive, that means that quasi-maximal greatness actually turns out to be impossible because a quasi-maximally great being would be a being that has necessary existence and therefore would exist in every possible world. He would be outside the omnipotent power of the maximally great being.

So our intuition that a maximally great being is possible is not undermined by the claim that a quasi-maximally great being is also intuitively possible because the latter intuition – the intuition that quasi-maximal greatness is exemplified – depends upon the assumption that a maximally great being cannot possibly exist. And that would beg the question. So long as maximal greatness is possible, then it would follow that quasi-maximal greatness is not.

Still, skeptics might insist that we don’t have any way of knowing in advance whether it is maximal greatness or quasi-maximal greatness which is possibly exemplified. The argument that I’ve just given shows that it can’t be both. You can’t have both a maximally great being and a quasi-maximally great being. They would be incompatible with each other because one would escape the omnipotence of the other. So you can’t have both. But the skeptic might say we don’t know if either one is possible. Our intuitions about modality are unreliable guides.

I think we can say here that the intuition that a maximally great being exists trumps any intuition that we might have that quasi-maximal greatness is possibly exemplified. You only arrive at the idea of quasi-maximal greatness by subtracting something from the concept of maximal greatness. In a sense it is parasitic on the concept of maximal greatness. If quasi-maximal greatness seems possible, all the more so maximal greatness would seem possible. That would give reason then for thinking that priority should be given to maximal greatness and not quasi-maximal greatness.

But could we say anything more in defense of the ontological argument’s key premise? Can we say something more than just modal intuitions – that it seems intuitive that this is a coherent concept? Plantinga, I think, provides a clue when he says that if we carefully ponder the key premise and the alleged objection to it, if we “consider its connections with other propositions we accept or reject and still find it compelling, we are within our rights in accepting it.” That is a far different story than the sort of a priori speculation that the skeptic denounces. Even if you cannot determine a priori (that is to say, in advance) whether or not maximal greatness is possibly exemplified, what Plantinga is suggesting is that we could come to believe that it is possible that a maximally great being exists on the basis of a posteriori considerations. That is to say on the basis of evidence and argument independent of our modal intuitions. What I want to do next time is to look at some of those considerations that might lend support to our modal intuitions that maximal greatness is indeed a coherent concept. If that is the case, then the basis for affirming premise (1) will not simply be our modal intuitions that this is a coherent concept, but that we also have some additional reasons for thinking that premise (1) is true.


We’ve been talking about the ontological argument, and I hope today to bring our discussion of that argument to a close. The last time we saw that the crucial premise in the argument is the first one. If you grant that premise, then the rest of the argument just follows automatically. If it’s possible that a maximally great being like God exists, then it follows necessarily that God does exist. So the question is what warrant there is for that first premise, and I argued that we can see that the concept of a maximally great being is a coherent concept. It’s not like a square circle or a married bachelor. This is a coherent notion that could possibly be instantiated. Therefore we have a prima facie warrant for thinking that that first premise is true, that it’s possible that a maximally great being exists.

So far we’ve been looking at a priori considerations in defense of the first premise of the ontological argument.  But Plantinga suggests is that there could also be some a posteriori reasons for thinking that premise (1) is true. That would put a very different face on the ontological argument. What might these be?

## The Value Argument

Joshua Rasmussen has offered what he calls “the Value Argument” in support of the key premiss of the ontological argument:[1]

Some degree of value can be instantiated.

If some degree of value can be instantiated, then each degree of value can be instantiated.

Therefore each degree of value can be instantiated.

Maximal greatness is a degree of value.

Therefore, maximal greatness can be instantiated.

This disarmingly simple argument provides some non-question-begging, a posteriori support for the first premise of the ontological argument. For our moral experience reveals that some degree of value is, in fact, instantiated, whence it follows that (1). As for (2), Rasmussen notes that a mere difference in degree of a value does not affect the possibility or impossibility of a value of that degree. Rather there is plausibly a modal continuity for degrees of value. In support of (4), he claims that maximal greatness is a determinant of value; namely, it is a maximum value. Every determinant of value is a degree of value. So maximal greatness, as a degree of value, can be instantiated.

I find the value argument very persuasive, and it increases my confidence that it is possible that a maximally great being exists.

Moreover, it seems to me that the other arguments of natural theology for the existence of God can go some distance toward justifying belief that it is possible that such a being exists. For example, Leibniz’s argument from contingency, certain versions of the moral argument for God’s existence, and the argument from the applicability of mathematics could lead us to think that it is plausible that maximal greatness is possibly exemplified.

For example, remember the Leibnizian argument from contingency that we’ve already talked about. It goes like this:

1. Everything that exists has an explanation of its existence. This explanation might either be a necessity of its own nature (in which case it is a metaphysically necessary being) or in some external cause.

2. If the universe has an explanation of its existence, that explanation is God.

3. The universe is an existing thing.

From these three premises it follows logically that:

4. Therefore the explanation of the existence of the universe is God (who is a being that exists by a necessity of his own nature).

Any being that exists by a necessity of its own nature is going to be a metaphysically necessary being. So Leibniz’s argument gives us good grounds for thinking that there is a metaphysically necessary being upon which everything else depends for its existence. So there are no limits to the power of this being. There are no non-logical limits to the power of this metaphysically necessary being because everything that exists depends upon it for its existence.

Or consider the moral argument for God’s existence. Again, we’ve already talked about the moral argument. It could be summarized like this:

1.   If God does not exist, then objective moral values and duties do not exist.

If there is no God then there is no absolute standard of right and wrong, good and evil. Everything becomes relative.

2.   Objective moral values and duties do exist.

Certain things are really right or really wrong. Certain things are really good or really evil.

3. Therefore God exists.

Now, if moral values and duties depend in this way upon the existence of God, then, since certain moral principles are necessarily true, it follows that the God who grounds them must be a metaphysically necessary being. That is, a being that exists in all possible worlds. For example, one naturalist philosopher of science, Michael Ruse, has written, “The man who says that it is morally acceptable to rape little children is just as mistaken as the man who says 2+2=5.”[2] Think of that statement. Here Ruse equates the truth of these moral principles with the elementary truths of arithmetic like 2+2=4. These are necessary truths. These are logical truths. Therefore these moral principles, to be grounded in God, require that God be a metaphysically necessary being who exemplifies these moral values necessarily. Therefore the moral argument also leads to the existence of a metaphysically necessary being who is not merely perfectly good but who is the actual standard of goodness, who is the paradigm of goodness from which all moral value derives.

Thirdly, in addition to this, we have the argument from the applicability of mathematics:

1.   If God does not exist, the applicability of mathematics is just ‘a happy coincidence.’

2.   The applicability of mathematics it’s not just ‘a happy coincidence.’

3.   Therefore, God exists.

We saw that the applicability of mathematics is best explained by saying that God constructed the physical world on the basis of the mathematical model that he had in mind. If mathematical truths and objects are thus grounded in the mind of God, then God must be a metaphysically necessary being. God is plausibly an infinite, metaphysically necessary person who grounds these mathematical objects. Thus you are brought to the conclusion of the existence of an omniscient, metaphysically necessary mind as the foundation of the applicability of mathematics..

Look at what these three arguments give us. Each one of them gives us a metaphysically necessary being – a being that exists in every possible world. The Leibnizian argument, the moral argument, the mathematical argument all yield a metaphysically necessary being. The Leibnizian argument gives you a being which is the source of all reality outside itself and therefore is plausibly all-powerful. The moral argument gives you a being which is morally perfect. The mathematical argument gives you an omniscient mind which grounds these mathematical truths. In other words, you’ve got here the elements that make up maximal greatness, don’t you? You’ve got metaphysical necessity, omnipotence, moral perfection, and omniscience.

So these other arguments of natural theology can provide support for the idea that it is possible that a maximally great being exists. I think here considerations of simplicity also come into play. For example, it is simpler – isn’t it? - to postulate one metaphysically necessary, infinite, omniscient, morally perfect being than to think that there are three separate beings that have these properties, that there are three metaphysically necessary beings – one of which is omniscient, one is morally perfect, and one is omnipotent. It is simpler to say that all of these arguments are leading to the one metaphysically necessary being who is omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect.

Moreover, as Richard Swinburne has pointed out, it seems plausible that it is simpler or less ad hoc (less contrived) to say that a property that comes in degrees has either zero or infinity as its value rather than some arbitrarily selected finite value in between. It would be simpler to just say it is infinite or it is zero rather than having an inexplicable finite value somewhere on the measurement scale. So it would be more plausible to think that maximal greatness is possibly instantiated than quasi-maximal greatness – a being which has infinite power, intelligence, and moral perfection.

So on the basis of these sorts of a posteriori considerations, I think that we could well consider ourselves to be warranted in believing that it is possible that a maximally great being exists.

Now the question which arises at this point is: Doesn’t the ontological argument now become question begging? What does it mean for an argument to be question begging? What it means is that your only reason for accepting a premise in the argument is that you already believe in the conclusion. You accept the premise because you already believe the conclusion is true. So you are begging the question or you are arguing in a circle. Let me give an example.

Consider this as argument for God’s existence.

1. Either God exists or the moon is made of green cheese.

2. The moon is not made of green cheese.

3. Therefore God exists.

That is a sound argument for God’s existence. Both of its premises are true. Since God does exist, it is true that either God exists or the moon is made of green cheese. In order for that disjunction to be true, one of the disjuncts needs to be true. Since God does exist, it is true that either God exists or the moon is made of green cheese. The second premise is true – the moon is not made of green cheese. Therefore God exists. So this is a logically valid argument with true premises which implies the existence of God. Yet no one would think this is a successful piece of natural theology. Why not? Because the only reason you would have for thinking that the first premise is true is because you already believe the argument’s conclusion that God exists. So you are reasoning in a circle. You are begging the question.

The question now is: if the reason that you think it is possible that a maximally great being exists is because you believe that a maximally great being does exist, then aren’t you similarly begging the question? If on the basis of the Leibnizian, moral, and mathematical arguments for God’s existence, you come to believe that a maximally great being exists, then of course it’s possible that he exists! You’ve already proven that he does! So doesn’t the ontological argument then become question-begging or redundant?

I think that this misgiving may result from thinking of the project of natural theology in too linear a fashion. We should not think of the arguments of natural theology as being like links in a chain, where the chain is only as strong as the weakest link. If the weak link is broken, then the whole chain is broken and becomes unable to bear the weight that you would want. We shouldn't think of the arguments of natural theology in that linear fashion, as like a chain of links which is only as strong as the weakest link. Rather the arguments of natural theology are more aptly compared to a coat of chain mail like the coat a knight used to wear, where the links all reinforce one another, so that the coat of mail is not as weak as the weakest link. The ontological argument can play, I think, an important role in a cumulative case for the existence of God in which a whole host of independent factors lead us to the overall conclusion Therefore God exists.”

It does seem to me that the ontological argument has a role to play as one of the links in the coat of mail – one of the arguments in a cumulative case for God’s existence. So the arguments taken together show that God, a maximally great being, does in fact exist.

With the ontological argument we draw to a close our discussion of the arguments of natural theology. This section of the course is vital in establishing the plausibility of a Christian worldview in a secular society. We’ve looked at the proper basicality of belief in God’s existence. We’ve looked at the contingency argument, the cosmological argument, the argument from the applicability of mathematics, the fine-tuning argument, the moral argument, and the ontological argument for God’s existence. These give us, not  the existence of a vaguely characterized being that could be the Flying Spaghetti Monster. Rather these give us a being replete with specific attributes like moral perfection, omnipotence, omniscience, metaphysical necessity, and so forth.

The arguments of natural theology for God’s existence are in a sense only one side of the coin because we also need to consider what are the arguments on the other side against the existence of God. Maybe there are such powerful arguments for atheism that they simply outweigh these arguments for God’s existence and tip the scale in the other direction. What we want to take up beginning next week will be arguments for atheism, and especially the problem of suffering and evil in the world. Isn’t the existence of an omnipotent, all-loving God, incompatible or improbable given the truly horrendous and innocent suffering in the world? How are we going to deal with that problem? That will be the question that we will take up next time.
