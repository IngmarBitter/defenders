## The *Kalam* Cosmological Argument

![](NatTheoPics/Pyramids.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

1) Whatever begins to exist has a cause

2) The universe began to exist

Conclusion

3) Therefore, the universe has a cause

---

## The Conclusion follows logically

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral4.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

3) Therefore, the universe has a cause

  Makes sense because

    it follows logically from (1) and (2)<br>
      1) Whatever begins to exist has a cause<br>
      2) The universe began to exist

---

## Premise 1) is reasonable

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral5.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

1) Whatever begins to exist has a cause

* Makes sense because
  * Something cannot come from nothing
    * Physical AND Metaphysical principle
  * If false, anything could come from nothing
    * Why only universes? Why only once?
    * Why not umbrellas, unicorns, or UFOs
  * If false, worse than magic
    * Magic: magician+ hat = rabbit
    * nothing + nothing = everything  … lol

---

## Premise 2) is reasonable physically

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral6.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

2) The universe began to exist

* Makes sense because
  * Tracing our expanding universe back in time terminates at a singularity, a beginning of time
  * Thermodynamics of the universe predict heat death
    * We are still alive, so no infinite time can have passed


---

## Premise 2) is reasonable metaphysically

![](NatTheoPics/HilbertsHotel.png style="float: right; width: 9rem")

2) The universe began to exist

* Makes sense because
  * If false, # of past events would be infinite
    * An actually infinite number of past events cannot exist
      * Otherwise Hilberts hotel could be real
    * A series formed successively cannot be actually infinite
      * Otherwise counting from infinity to 0 would have finished already

## Why are even the best objections unconvincing?

The cause of the universe is the Big Bang !?

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral7.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* This misses the point
  * The Big Bang is the initial expansion of the very early universe from a singularity
  * At the singularity and up to 10e-45 seconds physics does not apply
  * Afterward there are equations for the expansion
* We need an explanation of the cause of the singularity<br>
  not its change after coming into existence 

---

## Why are even the best objections unconvincing?

Then God must have a cause to explain Him !?

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral8.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* No we are not looking for an explanation of existence<br>
  but for a cause starting existence
* God did not begin to exist, thus needs no starter
* Otherwise “starter” would be greater than God
* Then the “starter” would be God
* An infinate "starter" chain is eliminated by Occam's Razor
* Thus God is outside of this argument

---

## Why are even the best objections unconvincing?

Physics examples of things coming from nothing!?

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral9.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* No, virtual particles come from the energy in the vacuum via E=mc2
* The vacuum is not nothing
* The cause is known
* Only the timing is not known

---

## Why are even the best objections unconvincing?

The universe could be a bubble in a multiverse!?

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral10.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Then the multiverse would be expanding, too
* Thus the multiverse would have a beginning, too

The universe could be pulsating big bang/crunch

* Still an overall closed system
  * Thus thermodynamics prediction still holds
  * Heat death should still occur after finite time
  * We are still alive, so no infinite time can have passed

## The Kalam Argument is "Sound"

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral11.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

**The Kalam Cosmological Argument**

1) Whatever begins to exist has a cause

2) The universe began to exist

Conclusions

3) Therefore, the universe has a cause

=> Premises are reasonable, conclusion is logical necessity

---

## What else can we conclude?

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral12.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

3) Therefore, the universe has a cause

* This cause beyond the universe must be
  * Immaterial
  * Not bound by space (spaceless)
  * Not bound by time (timeless)
  * Immensely powerful (omnipotent)
  * Necessarily existing (self existing)
  * Un-embodied mind / consciousness (can affect the physical world and can decide to create the universe)

---

## What else can we conclude?

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral13.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Immaterial, spaceless, timeless, omnipotent, self-existing, and un-embodied mind 
  * That is God!
* => God can be the God of
  * Judaism, Christianity, Islam
* => God is not likely the God of
  * Hinduism, Buddhism
* => These cannot be true
  * Atheism
    * Since we now have a good argument for God
  * Agnosticism
    * Since we can have good reason to believe in God

---

## God is the cause of the Universe

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral14.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* What is the cause of the universe?
  * God
