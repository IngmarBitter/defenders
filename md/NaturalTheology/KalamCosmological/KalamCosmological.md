## The *Kalam* Cosmological Argument

![](NatTheoPics/Pyramids.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

(1) **Whatever begins to exist has a cause**  

(2) **The universe began to exist**  

Conclusion  

(3) **Therefore, the universe has a cause**  

---

## The Conclusion Follows Logically

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral3.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

(3) Therefore, the universe has a cause  

Makes sense because  

  it follows logically from (1) and (2):  
    (1) Whatever begins to exist has a cause  
    (2) The universe began to exist  

---

## Premise (1) Is Reasonable

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral4.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

(1) Whatever begins to exist has a cause  

* Something cannot come from nothing  
  * Physical AND metaphysical principle  
* If false, anything could come from nothing:  
  * Why only universes? Why only once?  
  * Why not umbrellas, unicorns, or UFOs?  
* If false, worse than magic:  
  * Magic: magician + hat = rabbit  
  * Nothing + nothing = everything … lol  
* Empirical evidence supports causality:  
  * Observations in science consistently show causes for effects  

---

## (2) Is Reasonable Physically - Thermodynamics and Expansion

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral5.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

(2) The universe began to exist  

* Tracing our expanding universe back in time terminates at a singularity—a beginning of time.  
* Thermodynamics of the universe predict heat death:  
  * The sun still shines, so no infinite time can have passed  
* The Borde-Guth-Vilenkin theorem:  
  * Any universe that is expanding must have a finite past  
* Therefore, (2) is reasonable  

---

## (2) Is Reasonable Physically - Big Bang and Scientific Evidence

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral6.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

(2) The universe began to exist  

* The Friedman-LeMaître model predicts an expanding universe  
* Edwin Hubble's redshift observations confirm galaxies are moving apart  
* Space itself is expanding, not galaxies moving into pre-existing space  
* Tracing back leads to a boundary point: the beginning of space-time  
* The universe began to exist, supported by over 100 years of cosmological evidence, current mainstream view  
* Therefore, (2) is reasonable  

---

## (2) Is Reasonable Metaphysically - Infinites

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral7.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **Potential Infinity (∞):** A process that grows indefinitely but never completes  
  * Example: My age when in heaven  
* **Actual Infinity (ℵ₀, aleph null):** Count (#) of numbers in a static infinite collection  
  * Example: The # of numbers in {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} is ℵ₀  
  * Actual infinity (ℵ₀) is a concept in mathematics:  
    * But math makes no claim its concepts exist in the real world  
    * Specifically, no claim that there can be ℵ₀ many things or days  

---

## (2) Is Reasonable Metaphysically - Hilbert

![](NatTheoPics/HilbertsHotel.png style="float: right; width: 9rem")

(2) The universe began to exist  

* If false, # of past days would be infinite ℵ₀  
* But ℵ₀ past days cannot have existed  
* Otherwise, Hilbert's Hotel could be real:  
  * A hotel with ℵ₀ rooms, all occupied  
  * As new guests arrive, rooms are made available by shifting occupants: n → 2×n,...  
  * ℵ₀ guests can check in or out, leading to absurdities  
  * Subtracting identical infinities yields contradictory results:  
    * Remove all odd-numbered guests vs. all guests from room 4 on  

---

## (2) Is Reasonable Met. - Successive Addition

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral8.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

(2) The universe began to exist  

* The past is formed by adding one day after another:  
  * Like a row of dominoes falling one after another  
* No series formed by successive addition can be ℵ₀:  
  * You cannot count up to ℵ₀, since ℵ₀ - 1 = ℵ₀  
  * You cannot count down from ℵ₀, since ℵ₀ - 1 = ℵ₀  
* If the past were infinite, today could never be reached:  
  * An infinite number of days would need to occur first  
* Therefore, the series of past days must be finite  
* Therefore, (2) is reasonable  

---

## (2) Is Reasonable Met. - Grim Reaper Paradox

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral9.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

(2) The universe began to exist  

* Grim Reaper Paradox (A. Pruss and R. Koons):  
  * Imagine being alive eternally and targeted by infinitely many Grim Reapers, each set to strike at a specific time:  
    * Grim Reaper #1 strikes at 9am if you are alive  
    * Grim Reaper #2 strikes at 8am if you are alive  
    * Grim Reaper #3 strikes at 7am, and so on  
  * You cannot survive past 9am:  
    * But no Grim Reaper kills you because you would already be dead  
  * => Logical contradiction: An infinite past is impossible  

---

## (2) Is Reasonable Met. - Absurdities

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral10.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Saturn and Jupiter orbits:  
  * For every one orbit of Saturn, Jupiter completes two  
  * Over time, Saturn falls further behind  
  * If they orbited from eternity, they would have completed the same number of orbits ℵ₀:  
    * Absurd because the disparity grows 2× over time, but ℵ₀ = 2×ℵ₀  
* Is the number of orbits odd or even?  
  * Mathematically, it is both odd and even, since ℵ₀ = ℵ₀ + 1  
* Highlights the absurdity of an infinite past  
* Therefore, (2) is reasonable

## (1) Objection: God must have a cause

Then God must have a cause to explain Him !?

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral11.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* No we are not looking for an explanation of existence<br>
  but for a cause starting existence
* God did not begin to exist, thus needs no starter
* Otherwise “starter” would be greater than God
* Then the “starter” would be God
* An infinite "starter" chain is eliminated by Occam's Razor
* Thus God is outside of this argument
* God is a necessary being
  * Exists by the necessity of His own nature

---

## (2) Objection: Steady-State Model

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral12.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* The steady-state model proposes:
  * The universe has always existed in a constant state
  * Matter is continuously created to maintain density as the universe expands
* Problems with the steady-state model:
  * Disproved by observational evidence:
    * Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR)
    * Evolution of galaxies over time
  * Violates conservation laws of matter and energy
* Therefore, the steady-state model is untenable

---

## (1) Objection: Big Bang

The cause of the universe is the Big Bang !?

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral13.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* This misses the point
  * The Big Bang is the initial expansion of the very early universe from a singularity
  * At the singularity and up to 10e-45 seconds physics does not apply
  * Afterward there are equations for the expansion
* We need an explanation of the cause of the singularity,<br>
  not its change after coming into existence.
* The Big Bang itself requires a cause:
  * It cannot explain its own existence

---

## (1) Objection: Uncaused Vacuum Particles

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral14.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Virtual particles do not come from nothing, but from the energy in the vacuum via E=mc².
* The vacuum is not nothing, but quantum energy.
* The cause is known: energy-matter conversion.
* Only the timing is not known.
* If quantum fluctuations were possible as a source for matter:
  * Small fluctuations would be vastly more frequent than large ones.
  * The matter for the entire universe would require a huge fluctuation.
  * It would be much more likely for a single brain with a universe simulation (Boltzmann brain) to fluctuate into existence.
  * Rationality would force us to believe we are Boltzmann brains rather than part of a larger universe—which defeats this objection.

---

## (2) Objection: Multiverse

The universe could be a bubble in a multiverse!?

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral5.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* The multiverse would also be expanding.
* The Borde-Guth-Vilenkin theorem applies to expanding multiverses:
  * Any expanding multiverse must have a finite past.
* Thus, the multiverse would also have a beginning.
* Therefore, the multiverse hypothesis does not avoid the need for a beginning

---

## (2) Objection: Pulsating Model

The universe could be eternal through cycles of Big Bang expansion and Big Crunch contraction!?

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral6.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Thermodynamics problem:
  * Each cycle would lose usable energy<br>(entropy increases).
  * Cycles would grow longer and larger over time
  * Heat death would eventually occur.
* Observational evidence problem:
  * No evidence of prior cycles.
  * Current expansion is accelerating, not contracting.
* Therefore, the pulsating model is untenable

## The Kalam Argument Is "Sound"

![](NatTheoPics/Pyramids.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

**The Kalam Cosmological Argument**

(1) **Whatever begins to exist has a cause**

(2) **The universe began to exist**

Conclusion

(3) **Therefore, the universe has a cause**

=> Premises are reasonable; the conclusion is a logical necessity.
=> Supported by both philosophical arguments and scientific evidence

---

## What does this imply for God?

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral8.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

(3) Therefore, the universe has a cause

* This cause beyond the universe must be:
  * Immaterial
  * Not bound by space (spaceless)
  * Not bound by time (timeless)
  * Immensely powerful (omnipotent)
  * Necessarily existing (self-existing)
  * Un-embodied mind / consciousness (can affect the physical world and can decide to create the universe)
  * Personal: Only a personal agent can choose to create a temporal effect from a timeless state

---

## Which God Fits these Properties?

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral9.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Immaterial, spaceless, timeless, omnipotent, self-existing, un-embodied mind, and personal
  * That is God!
* => Christianity, Judaism, Islam are rational
  * all three have a God with these properties
* => Hinduism, Buddhism are **not** rational
  * Excluded by Immaterial but Personal
* => Atheism and Agnosticism are **not** rational
  * Since we now have a good argument for God
* => Pantheism is **not** rational
  * God is distinct from the universe, not identical to it

---

## God Is The Cause Of The Universe

![](NatTheoPics/Spiral10.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* What is the cause of the universe?
  * God
