## What is Natural Theology?

![](NatTheoPics/NatTheo.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Explores justification of Christianity's truth claims **apart from authoritative divine revelation**
* Seeks warrant for Christian beliefs without appealing to inspired Scripture as authority
* Scripture may be used as historical documents, but not as revelation
* Asks: What can we know about God from reason and the created order?

---

## Natural Theology vs. General Revelation

![](NatTheoPics/GodFingerprint.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **General revelation**: God's self-disclosure in nature and conscience
  * Like fingerprints of the potter in the clay
* **Natural theology**: human reflection on general revelation
  * Like human assessment of the fingerprints in the clay
  * Arguments are human constructs, not divinely given
  * You are free to disagree with any argument presented
  * Fallible and evolving — each generation refines them
    * Maybe we can improve them?

---

## The Renaissance of Natural Theology

![](NatTheoPics/BookThink.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Recent decades: renewed interest in natural theology in philosophy
* Example: *Blackwell Companion to Natural Theology* — advanced essays on arguments for God
* Many arguments exist; we will focus on five key ones
  * Kalam, Leibnits, Fine Tuning, Moral, Ontology

---

## The Cumulative Case Approach

![](NatTheoPics/ChainMail.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Don't rely on a single argument — think **cumulative case**
* Each argument reinforces the others
* Analogy: not a chain (weakest link fails), but chain mail (links reinforce each other)
* Even weak arguments can contribute to a strong overall case

---

## Arguments in Isolation and Together

![](NatTheoPics/Arguments.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* If each argument is good alone, the cumulative case is even stronger
* Example: DNA evidence, eyewitnesses, and video — each strong, together overwhelming
* We'll examine arguments both individually and as a whole

---

## Deductive Arguments for God

![](NatTheoPics/Logic.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Arguments are presented deductively: clear premises leading to a conclusion
* Advantages:
  * Simple to grasp and memorize
  * Easy to discuss—ask which premise is rejected and why
* Goal: formulate arguments that are **logically valid**, **sound** and **warranted**

---

## What Makes a Good Argument?

![](NatTheoPics/GoodArgument.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **Logically valid**: conclusion follows from premises
* **Sound**: premises are true
* **Warranted**: premises have evidence or justification
* Example of a trivially valid but unconvincing argument:
  1. Either the moon is made of green cheese or God exists.
  2. The moon is not made of green cheese.
  3. Therefore, God exists.
* The only reason to believe premise 1 is if you already believe the conclusion — circular reasoning

---

## How Much Evidence is Needed?

![](NatTheoPics/EvidenceScales.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Controversial: How strong must the evidence for premises be?
* Some say: enough to **permit** belief
* Others (like Craig): evidence should make premises **more plausible than their negations**
* Example: Kalam cosmological argument
  1. Whatever begins to exist has a cause.
  2. The universe began to exist.
  3. Therefore, the universe has a cause.
* The first premise is nearly certain; focus is on plausibility of the second

---

## Good Argument Summary

![](NatTheoPics/ScaleGoodArgument.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* ***Good Premises***
  * **Sound**: are true.
  * **Warranted**: common sense test, more plausible than negation.
* ***Good Conclusion***
  * **Logically Valid**: follows logically from premises.
* **Impact**
  * Conclusion can be denied only if a premise is false.

## Properly Basic Belief: Introduction

![](NatTheoPics/Plantinga.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Not really an argument for God's existence
* Claim: You can know God exists **apart from arguments**
* Still part of natural theology—belief in God can be rational and warranted by natural reason, without argument
* Chief proponent: Alvin Plantinga (Book: *Warranted Christian Belief*)

---

## Plantinga and Reformed Epistemology

![](NatTheoPics/BeliefReasons.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Plantinga: belief in God can be **warranted** apart from arguments
* Arguments are sufficient but not necessary for rational belief
* This is called **Reformed Epistemology** (after John Calvin)

---

## Properly Basic Beliefs

![](NatTheoPics/matrix.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Some beliefs are rational to hold without argument — **properly basic**
* Examples:
  * Reality of the past
  * Existence of the external world - no matrix
  * Presence of other minds - not just AI
* These cannot be proved by argument, but are foundational to our thinking

---

## Properly Basic Beliefs Are Grounded

![](NatTheoPics/matrix.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Properly basic beliefs are not arbitrary — they are **appropriately grounded** in experience
* Example: Sensing the world around you grounds belief in its reality
* You are rational to accept these beliefs unless given a good reason (defeater) not to

---

## Discussion: Illusion and Proper Basicality

![](NatTheoPics/budda.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* How to respond to someone who claims the world is an illusion (e.g., Buddhist or Hindu)?
  * You don't try to argue for the external world — it's properly basic
  * Burden is on the skeptic to provide a defeater
* Even those who claim the world is illusion live as if it is real
  * Pure illusions would not plan for the future

---

## Can Atheism Be Properly Basic?

![](NatTheoPics/MatrixNoGod.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Could an atheist claim atheism is properly basic?
  * Difficult: what experience would ground belief in God's nonexistence?
  * Theist can appeal to the witness of the Holy Spirit
  * Atheist lacks a comparable grounding mechanism
  * Absense of evidence is not evidence for absense
    * Elephant vs ant in room?
    * Spagetty monster vs immaterial God in room?

---

## Belief in God Is Appropriately Grounded

![](NatTheoPics/Experience.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* In the Bible, God is known as an **experienced reality**, not an inferred idea
* Prof John Hick: God was "a sheer given reality" to biblical people
* Belief in God is grounded in the **experience of God** — the witness of the Holy Spirit

---

## Next Steps

![](NatTheoPics/innerWitness.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Next: Explore the **inner witness of the Holy Spirit**
* How this warrants belief in God for both believers and unbelievers
* Also: How to handle defeaters for belief in God
