Eternal Security
==========================================

Not a salvation issue, no official church position
--------------------------------------------------
How much confidence can a person have in his eternal destination? Once you say you believe in Jesus Christ, is your
salvation secure no matter how you behave? What if you change your mind and say you no longer believe? Our position at
Creekside Christian Church is that this is an important issue, but not an essential doctrine foundational to the church.
When discussing this issue and other similar issues, we would be wise to remember a popular Christian slogan: "In
doctrine
unity, in opinion liberty, in all things love."

We believe Christians have the freedom to disagree about this issue. Therefore, Creekside Christian Church does not take
an
official church stance on the issue of eternal security.

Believing now saves us
----------------------
We believe that a person is saved by the grace of God through faith in Jesus Christ (Eph. 2:8).

Not believing now means we are not saved
----------------------------------------
A person who does not have faith in Christ, or is living in rebellion against him, should not
expect to be saved, regardless of his past (Heb. 3:8,12; 10:26; 2 Pet. 2:20-22). Some will say that such a person "was
never saved
in the first place," because God knew in his Sovereignty that the person would reject Christ in the end. Whether the
person was
saved then lost, or never saved in the first place, is not clearly addressed in Scripture, and both sides of the debate
can point to Scriptures to defend their position. The Bible says God is Sovereign and knows the future. But the
Scripture also
warns the saved person against falling away (2 Tim. 2:12-13; Heb 2: 1; 3:8-12; 2 Pet. 2:20-22; 3:17). The argument may
simply
be semantic because the end result is the same on both sides: a person who once believed but has become apostate is not
saved. Nearly all Christians agree on this point. Some believe that once you are saved you may live an unrighteous life
or even reject Christ without losing your salvation; but they are ignoring a vast amount of biblical evidence to the
contrary, and such teaching has dangerous consequences.

Primary teaching at Creekside: God keeps guaranteeing our salvation as long as we keep believing
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because of the Scriptures mentioned above and others warning the saved person against falling away,
the primary teaching of the leadership at Creekside has been that it is possible for a
person to "throw away" salvation through willful and continual rebellion.
Salvation is the free gift of God, available to all, and God desires that all be saved (1 Tim. 2:4).
Every individual has the choice to accept or reject God's offer of forgiveness. Once a person is saved, that salvation
cannot be lost through one sin, or even a series of sins. But, as Hebrews 10:26 says, "If we deliberately keep on
sinning after
we have received the knowledge of the truth," we may get to a point where our hearts are so hard that we reject Christ
and
want no part of his salvation anymore, at which point, "no sacrifice for sins is left." Jesus said in John 3:16,
"Whoever
believes in [God's Son] shall not perish but have eternal life." The word "believes" in the original Greek is in the
present tense, denoting continual action. Whoever "continues to believe" will have eternal life. Someone who believed as a
youngster but rejects that belief in later life should not expect to be granted the promise of eternal life. God is not
going to force anyone into heaven against his or her will.
The traditional teaching at Creekside in this area has been one of conditional salvation: you are saved as long as
you continue to believe and unless you become an unbeliever or "apostate" (one who rejects his religion). But a
person is not required to agree with the leadership's position on this doctrine in order to become a member or
even to be eligible for a leadership role.

Respect the leadership's position and teach both sides
------------------------------------------------------
However, we do ask those who hold to eternal security to be respectful of the leadership's position and to
seek to honestly present both sides of the issue when teaching on this subject.

Your salvation is secure
------------------------
We also believe that it is important to
remind every Christian that if you have put your faith and trust in Jesus Christ, your salvation is secure. If you are a
sincere believer, then questioning your salvation is wrong. It is not a sign of humility or showing your awareness of
your sins; to question your salvation shows a lack of faith in the promise of God to save you. It is often a sign that you question
whether God is big enough or gracious enough to forgive your sin. If you trust in the substitutionary death of Christ on
the cross, then you should have assurance of your salvation (1 John 5:13). If you have wandered from the Lord, then you
should repent and return to Christ lest you harden your heart, reject him and lose your salvation. Peter warned us to be on
guard lest we be carried away by evil men and fall from our "secure position" (2 Pet. 3:17). Rest assured, your salvation is
secure, as long as you remain in faith. Your God is big enough to forgive your sins.

Tolerance for diversity of views
--------------------------------
Some -- even in our own church body -- may disagree strongly with our traditional teaching on this issue. We hope that
shows our tolerance toward those who disagree, and we hope that those who disagree will show the same tolerance to us.
Let us humbly admit that there are mysteries in Scripture which will not be fully understood until the return of Christ,
and let's renew our commitment to practice love and tolerance toward fellow believers who do not agree with us on
secondary
doctrines. Jesus prayed, "May they be brought to complete unity to let the world know that you sent me and have loved
them even as you have loved me" (John 17:23).

Can I ever "lose" my salvation?
===

Can I ever "lose" my salvation? -- No
---
Salvation is a gift that is meant to be permanent and eternal. The apostle Paul writes about Christians that "Having
believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance
until the
redemption of those who are God's possession..." (Ephesians 1:13-14). It is therefore impossible to lose your salvation

Can I "throw away" my salvation? - Yes
---
-- however,
the New Testament makes mention of the unlikely possibility that someone who is genuinely saved would throw
away his or her own salvation by permanently rejecting the Holy Spirit, by turning his or her back on Christ
permanently, or by turning his back on the gospel in favor of Old Testament law. Hebrews 6:4-6 reveals the possibility
of this rare
exception.
While we do not focus on this exception, and while we certainly do not pass judgment on those who have "backslidden," we
do take very seriously the Scriptural mandates to "stand firm to the end," "not put out the Spirit's fire," "bring back
those who have wandered from the truth." Matthew 10:22 states "All men will hate you because of me, but he who stands
firm to
the end will be saved." James 5:19-20 "My brothers, if one of you should wander from the truth, and someone should bring
him back, remember this: Whoever turns a sinner from the error of his way will save him from death and cover over a
multitude of sins." Colossians 1:21-23 "Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your
evil behavior. But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight,
without blemish and free from accusation - if you continue in your faith, established and firm, not moved from the hope
held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven,
and of which I, Paul, have become a servant."

Seriousness
-----------
Eternal Security. This is a non-salvation issue. You can be wrong about this issue and still be a Christian.

Arminian Perspective
--------------------
Arminians believe salvation can be gained and lost.
Arminians do not believe that a bad decision means you lose your salvation.
The way you can tell a person is a Christian is by their fruit.
Scripture References: Luke 15; Romans 11:22-23; Hebrews 6:4-7; 2 Peter 2:20

Calvinist Perspective
---------------------
Calvinists believe God chooses some to be saved and some to be lost.
Calvinists believe salvation cannot be lost as it was given by God.
Calvinists do not believe you can do whatever you want and be a Christian.
If a person is not showing fruit and growth, then they were never saved to begin with.
Scripture References: John 10:28; Romans 8:29-30; 1 John 2:9

Shared Perspective
------------------
Both camps would agree that Christians are known by their fruit. At Creekside Christian we encourage everyone to grow in
Christ -- we're not the judge of your salvation.
