# Baptism

Ingmar Bitter

## The Meaning of Baptism

Baptism is the full submersion in water of a believer in Christ, accompanied by the declaration that the individual is baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
!!!
    Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit

    - Mat 28:19 MEV

Baptism is the public outward symbolic expression of the believer's already established internal commitment to trust Christ as Lord and Savior, based on His death, burrial and resurrection.

Immersion in water sybolizes Christ's death and burrial, signifying the washing away of the believer's sins. 

Going into the water the believer remembers the old guilty self that justly deserved death. Under water the believer associates Christ's death with his own death penalty being paid and being cleared of all guilt before God.

Emerging from the water symbolizes Christ's resurrection to new life and the believer associates it with his own spiritual new life in Christ as redeemed, forgiven, loved, and adopted child of God.

!!!
    Do you not know that we who were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into His death?   ​Therefore we were buried with Him by baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.
    - Rom 6:3-4 MEV

!!!
    And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He has resurrected together with Him, having forgiven you all sins.
    - Col 2:12 MEV

### Baptism by Full Immersion

There are several compelling reasons to practice baptism by full immersion:

**Meaning of the Greek Word:** The New Testament term "βαπτίζω" (baptizo) means "to immerse," "to submerge," or "to dip."  It was used in various contexts, such as the sinking of a ship, the dyeing of a garment (where the cloth is completely dipped into dye), or the drawing of water by dipping a vessel. All of those result in the object of baptizo being fully submerged.

**Symbolism Alignment:** The symbolism of being buried with Christ (Romans 6:3) resonates most meaningfully when the believer is fully submerged.

**Jesus' Example:** Jesus Himself was baptized by full immersion in the Jordan River.

!!!
    9 In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.   10 ​Coming up out of the water, He immediately saw the heavens opened and the Spirit descending on Him like a dove.
    - Mark 1:9-10 MEV

**New Testament Practice**: Other New Testament accounts of Baptisms were rivers when a caraffe of water was closer and easier to use, but nonetheless the baptism was in a river, suggesting that it was by full immersion.

!!!
    The whole region of Judea and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him [John the Baptist] and were all baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
    
    - Mark 1:5

!!!
    John also was baptizing in Aenon toward Salim, because much water was there. And people came and were baptized.

    - John 3:23

!!!
    36 ​As they went on their way, they came to some water. And the eunuch said, “Look, here is water. What hinders me from being baptized?”   ​37 Philip said, “If you believe with all your heart, you may.” He answered, “I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.”   38 ​And he commanded the chariot to halt. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and he baptized him.

    - Acts 8:36-38

**Humbling submission:** Baptism as an act of humble submission to God is more profound when it involves full immersion.

**Personal Experience:** For many believers, full immersion provides a more impactful and tangible experience, symbolizing a deep spiritual transformation.

## The Significance of Baptism for Believers

Baptism is a commanded practice for Christians, as explicitly stated in Matthew 28:19. There is no biblical directive to delay or avoid baptism. Hence, it is universally commanded for Christians and often a prerequisite for church membership.

!!!
    Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
    - Mat 28:19 MEV

In contemporary times, when an adult embraces Christianity, their public verbal declaration of belief is typically seen as a sign of their faith in Christ.  The subsequent baptism is the right thing to do, but with little social consequences. However, in the New Testament era, this practice differed significantly. Baptism, rather than a mere verbal confession, was the primary expression of a new faith, especially significant within the Jewish community. While a mere confession of faith could be overlooked or disregarded by the Jewish community, baptism in the name of Jesus Christ wwrepresented a more profound and consequential act that could lead to expulsion from the Jewish temple and its religious community. This severe repercussion underscored the depth of commitment to the Christian faith, as it demonstrated that the individual placed their belief in Jesus above the conventions and expectations of Jewish culture.

## Prompt Baptism After Committing to Christ

Baptism should be administered as soon as possible after an individual commits to Christ. It is a significant and memorable way to publicly express one's faith and decision to follow Jesus.  Typically, baptisms are conducted the following Sunday morning in the presence of the church corgregation to witness and celebrate. Special occasions, such as Easter Sunday, might involve river- or ocean-baptisms that new believers may choose to wait a little longer than a week for.

Several New Testament examples illustrate the practice of baptizing new believers immediately after they commit to Christ:

**The Day of Pentecost (Acts 2:41):** About three thousand people believed and were baptized following Peter's sermon.

!!!
    Then those who gladly received his word were baptized, and that day about three thousand souls were added to them.

    - Acts 2:41 MEV

**The Ethiopian Eunuch (Acts 8:36-38):** Philip shared the gospel with an Ethiopian eunuch. Upon understanding and accepting the message, the eunuch requested being baptised. Philip confirmed the sinerity of his belief and then bapized him.

!!!
    ​As they went on their way, they came to some water. And the eunuch said, “Look, here is water. What hinders me from being baptized?”   ​Philip said, “If you believe with all your heart, you may.” He answered, “I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.”   ​And he commanded the chariot to halt. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and he baptized him.

    -Acts 8:36-38 MEV

**The Conversion of Saul/Paul (Acts 9:1-18):** Saul, later known as Paul, experienced a dramatic conversion on the road to Damascus. After being blinded he trusted and followed Jesus's command and then was visited by Ananias, who laid hands on him, Saul regained his sight and was baptized immediately after.

!!!
    Immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he could see again. And he rose up and was baptized.

    - Acts 9:18 MEV

**Cornelius and His Household (Acts 10:44-48):** Cornelius, a Roman centurion, and his household heard the gospel preached by Peter. They received the Holy Spirit, and Peter commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.

!!!
    47 “Can anyone forbid water for baptizing these, who have received the Holy Spirit as we have?”   48 ​So he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. [...]

    - Acts 10:47-48 MEV

**Lydia and Her Household (Acts 16:14-15):** Lydia, a seller of purple cloth in Philippi, heard Paul’s message, believed and was baptized along with her household.

!!!
    14 ​A woman named Lydia, a seller of purple fabric of the city of Thyatira, who worshipped God, heard us. The Lord opened her heart to acknowledge what Paul said.   15 ​When she and her household were baptized, she entreated us, saying, “If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and remain there.” And she persuaded us.

    - Acts 16:14-15 MEV

**The Philippian Jailer and His Family (Acts 16:30-33):** After an earthquake freed Paul and Silas from prison, the Philippian jailer asked them what he must do to be saved. They shared the gospel with him, he and all his family were baptized.

!!!
    30 He then led them out and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”   ​31 They said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you and your household will be saved.”   32 ​And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his household.   33 ​In that hour of the night he took them and washed their wounds. And immediately he and his entire household were baptized.
    
    - Acts 16:30-33 MEV

## Considering Rebaptism

Rebaptism may be considered for those uncertain about their initial baptism due to lack of memory, coercion, or a previous lack of genuine faith. However, rebaptism is not necessary for those who have sinned post-baptism but rather, repentance and seeking forgiveness are advised (Acts 8:14-24).

!!!
    14 Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that **Samaria had received the word of God**, they sent Peter and John to them.   15 ​When they came down, they prayed for them that they **might receive the Holy Spirit**,   ​16 **for still He had come on none of them. They were only baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus**.   17 ​Then **they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit**.
    
    18 ​When Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,   ​saying, “Give me also this power, that whomever I lay hands on may receive the Holy Spirit.”
    
    20 ​Peter said to him, “May your money perish with you, because you thought you could purchase the gift of God with money!   21 ​You have neither part nor share in this matter, for your heart is not right before God.   22 ​Therefore repent of your wickedness, and ask God if perhaps the intention of your heart may be forgiven you.   ​23 For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.”
    
    24 ​Then Simon answered, “Pray to the Lord for me that nothing you have spoken may come upon me.”

    - Acts 8:14-24 MEV

## Baptism as a Unifying Force Among Believers

Emphasizing unity in the Christian faith, baptism is a shared experience among believers (Ephesians 4:5). We advocate for unity and understanding in baptismal practices, underlining the importance of God's truth and the unity it brings (John 17:20-23).

Baptism acts as a unifying experience among Christians, as emphasized in Ephesians 4:5. It fosters unity and understanding in baptismal practices, underscoring the significance of God's truth and the unity it imparts among believers (John 17:20-23).

!!!
    2 ​With all humility, meekness, and patience, bearing with one another in love,   ​3 be eager to **keep the unity** of the Spirit in **the bond of peace**.   4 ​There is one body and one Spirit, even as you were called in one hope of your calling,   5 ​one Lord, one faith, **one baptism**,   6 ​one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.

    - Ephesians 4:2-6 MEV

!!!
    20 ​“I do not pray for these alone, but also for those who will believe in Me through their word,   21 ​that **they may all be one**, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You. May **they also be one in Us**, that the world may believe that You have sent Me.   22 ​I have given them the glory which You gave Me, that **they may be one** even as We are one:   23 ​I in them and You in Me, that **they may be perfect in unity**, and that the world may know that You have sent Me, and have loved them as You have loved Me.

    - John 17:20-23 MEV

## Baptism Very Important but not Essential for salvation

Baptism holds significant importance for all followers of Christ.  A valid question is, if it is even more than that? Is it essential? I.e. is it a requirement for forgiveness of sin, for receiving the Holy Spirit and for being saved, as Acts 2:38 and other passages might suggest? If so, then baptism is a requirement for salvation, which implies that Jesus' sacrifice alone isn't sufficient for salvation and that salvation is contingent upon the works of baptism.

Hence, to align with the consistent teachings of the Bible, one of these two two difficult tasks must be solved:

**Essential:** This viewpoint necessitates reconciling verses emphasizing salvation through faith alone (e.g., Ephesians 2:8-9, Romans 3:28, 4:4-5, 5:1, Galatians 2:16, Titus 3:5, John 3:16,18,36, 5:24, 6:53-54, 8:24, Acts 16:31) with the notion that salvation involves both faith and works. This perspective also must account for instances of salvation prior to baptism in the New Testament and Paul's conviction that baptism was not an important part of his ministry. Most evangelical churches do not subscribe to this interpretation.

**Important:** This interpretation seeks to harmonize scriptures suggesting baptism's essentiality with the broader biblical context that emphasizes faith alone for salvation. This section explores this alternative.

### Looks like Baptism might be required

#### Acts 2:38: Repent and be baptized for the forgiveness of sin

This verse, when understood in its full context, suggests that Peter's exhortation to "repent and be baptized" was a condensed version of a broader message that included belief in Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection. The phrase "for the forgiveness of sins" could mean "because of" forgiveness already received. Thus, baptism is seen as an important act following belief, not a prerequisite for salvation.

!!!
    37 When they heard this, **they were stung in the heart** and said to Peter and to the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, **what shall we do?**”

    38 Peter said to them, **“Repent and be baptized**, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for **the forgiveness of sins**, and you shall **receive the gift of the Holy Spirit**.   39 [...]

    40 **With many other words** he testified and exhorted them, saying, “Be saved from this perverse generation.”

    - Acts 2:37-38,40 MEV

That *for* can mean "because of" we see in ordinary English too: When I tell the barrista, "here is money *for* a latte", then first is the cause for the second. But when I tell her, "come to the party *for* my birthday", then the latter is the cause for the former. Thus, the causing phrase could be before or after the word *for*. A quite similar example where it is clear that the causing phrase is in Matthew 3:11:

!!!
    “I baptize you with water for repentance, [...]

    - Mat 3:11

Is the baptizing causing the repentance or the repentance causing the willingness to be baptized? Clearly, unrepentant people would not agree to nor see any need to be baptized. So it must be that John was baptizing people that were already repentant, and this repentance was causing them to want to be baptized. And Acts 2:38 uses the same Greek word for "*for*" making it very reasonable to interpret the verse analogous as "because you have received the forgiveness of sins, be baptized". See [GotQuestions.org/baptism-Acts-2-38](https://www.gotquestions.org/baptism-Acts-2-38.html).  

Most likely Peter was sure that many of the Jews had started to believe in Jesus as Lord and savior and he called them to rightaway publicly demonstrate the sincerity of their belief of being forgiven through baptism.

Quite similar, the "you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" is for the package of "repent + belief + baptism", where the first two are essential and the last one is a consequence of belief just as receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit is a consequence of belief.

This interpretation allows for a literal reading of Acts 2:38 that is consistent with the wider context teaching that salvation is not by works, by faith alone. And that therefore baptism is not an essential requirement for salvation, but an an associated commanded action.

#### [Mark 16:16](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Mark 16.16) 

!!!
    “He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned”.

    - Mark 16:16

The verse does not talk about believers that are not baptized and especially not that he who is not baptized is condemned. It emphasizes belief as the primary requirement for salvation, with baptism as an important subsequent step.
See [gotquestions.org/baptism-Mark-16-16](https://www.gotquestions.org/baptism-Mark-16-16.html).

#### [1 Peter 3:21](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1 Pet 3.21)

!!!
    Figuratively this is like **baptism, which also saves us** now. It is not washing off the dirt from the body, but a response to God **from a good conscience through the resurrection of Jesus Christ**,

    - 1 Peter 3:21 MEV

Here the second part of the verse is to clarify the meaning of the first, namely that the significance of the baptism is not the "washing of the dirt" (the physical action of baptism) but "a response to God from a good conscience". That means a response that is given after one's conscience has been made good. That implies it is after one's sins are forgiven and salvation has been received. Thus baptism cannot be a prerequisite for salvation.
See [gotquestions.org/baptism-1Peter-3-21](https://www.gotquestions.org/baptism-1Peter-3-21.html)

#### [John 3:3-7](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John 3.3-7)

!!!
    “Jesus answered and said to him, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.' Nicodemus said to Him, 'How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born, can he?' Jesus answered, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born again.'"

"born of water" is not the same as "baptism" and baptism into Jesus was not commanded and not even known at the time of this verse, so it cannot teach that such baptism is necessarry. Instead, it is likely referring spiritual cleansing and renewal by the Holy Spirit.
See [gotquestions.org/baptism-John-3-5](https://www.gotquestions.org/baptism-John-3-5.html)

#### [Acts 22:16](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Acts 22.16)

!!!
    "And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized and wash your sins away, calling on his name."

    - Acts 22:16

This verse does not say that the being baptized is what washes the sins away. It states two different commands: 1) baptism, 2) washing ones sins, to be done through "calling on His name" which means by believe in Christ.
See [gotquestions.org/baptism-Acts-22-16](https://www.gotquestions.org/baptism-Acts-22-16.html)

#### [Galatians 3:27](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gal 3.27)

!!!
    “For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.”

    - Gallatians 3:27

Baptism here can be seen as baptism by the Holy Spirit, not by water. Thus it does not teach that baptism by water is a requirement for salvation.

Alternatively, if baptized is understood as believer's water baptism, then every one that was baptized also believed. And as such it is true that they were saved, or as stated here, "clothed with Christ". However, not based of the baptism, but based on the underlying prior belief.

See [gotquestions.org/baptism-Galatians-3-27](https://www.gotquestions.org/baptism-Galatians-3-27.html)

#### Summary

All verses that look like baptism might be required for salvation have reasonable interpretations consistent with the view that while baptism is indeed very important, it is not essential as necessary requirement for salvation.

### Scriptural Evidence Against Baptism's Essentiality for Salvation

We will ignore most of the long list of verses that teaches that salvation is not by works, but by faith alone. They need to be adressed by anyone defending the view that baptism is essential.  Instead, we will focus on verses that show that salvation was granted clearly independent of baptism.

#### Acts 10:44-48: 

!!!
    44  While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word.   45  All the believers of the circumcision who had come with Peter were astonished, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles.   46  For they heard them speaking in other tongues and magnifying God. Then Peter continued,   47  “Can anyone forbid water for baptizing these, who have received the Holy Spirit as we have?”   48  So he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they asked him to stay a few days.

Cornelius and his household were filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke in tongues before they were baptized in water (Acts 10:44-48). And in John 14:17 Jesus states that an unbeliever cannot receive the Holy Spirit. Hence, they were already saved before their baptism.

#### [John 3:16](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John 3.16)

!!!
    “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.

    - John 3:16

This states the conditions for salvation. If water baptism was one of them it should be mentioned, but is not.

#### [1 Corinthians 15:1-8](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1 Cor 15.1-8) 

!!!
    1  Now, brothers, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which you have received, and in which you stand.   2  Through it you are saved, if you keep in memory what I preached to you, unless you have believed in vain.  3  For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: how Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,   4  was buried, rose again the third day according to the Scriptures,   5  and was seen by Cephas, and then by the twelve.   6  Then He was seen by over five hundred brothers at once, of whom the greater part remain to this present time, though some have passed away.   7  Then He was seen by James and then by all the apostles.   8  Last of all, He was seen by me also, as by one born at the wrong time.

This is one of the most clear statements of the conditions for salvation. If water baptism was one of them it should be mentioned, but is not.

#### Paul on baptism:

!!!
    14 I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius, 15 [...] 16 [...]

    17 For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to evangelize [...]

    - 1 Corinthians 14,17

In this passage Paul is arguing against the divisions that plagued the Corinthian church. Nonetheless, if baptism was necessary for salvation, why did Paul say he was thankful he baptized so few people? Why that he was *not* sent to baptize? If baptism was necessary for salvation, Paul essentially said, “I am thankful I saved so few ...” and “For Christ did not send me to save ...”. That would be an unbelievably ridiculous statement for Paul to make. (See https://www.gotquestions.org/baptism-salvation.html )

#### [Ephesians 2:8-9](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Eph 2.8-9) 

!!!
    8  For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not of yourselves. It is the gift of God,   9  not of works, so that no one should boast.   10  For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, so that we should walk in them.

This teaches that salvation is by faith alone. Adding any works, incl. water baptism, would make it no longer by faith alone. Thus water baptism is not a requirement.

[Titus 3:5](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Titus 3.5) 

!!!
    5  not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of rebirth and the renewal of the Holy Spirit,

This teaches that salvation is by faith alone. Adding any works, incl. water baptism, would make it no longer by faith alone. Thus water baptism is not a requirement.

#### Conclusion: Not essential but a very important command

The analysis shows that while baptism is not a necessary requirement for salvation - reserved solely for faith in Jesus' sacrificial death, burial, and resurrection - it is not to be viewed as unimportant or optional. Baptism remains a vital command for believers to follow soon after committing to Christ as their Lord and Savior.

Given that the word *for* in the typical translations of Acts 2:38 can be misleading, when we baptize new believers it should be with just the first part: "I baptize you in the name of the Father, son and Holy Spirit." or with the clearer addition of "because of your already forgiven sin and already received gift of the Holy Spirit".
