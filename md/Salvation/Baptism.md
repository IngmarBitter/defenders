## The Meaning of Baptism

![](BaptismMeaning.jpg style="float: right; width: 11rem")

Baptism is the full submersion in water of a new believer in Christ, accompanied by the declaration that the individual is baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
!!!
    Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit

    - Mat 28:19 MEV

As new believers, we commit to making Jesus our Lord, which includes being obedient to His commands. Baptism signifies the public initiation into the community of Christ-followers and, in many cases, the completion of the process of coming to saving faith. When we undergo baptism, it demonstrates that our commitment has matured from the intellectual realm to practical action, guiding our behavior. When part of the conversion process, the act of baptism completes the process of coming to saving faith and gives the new believer the confidence that he is now trusting Jesus as his Lord and Savior and that God has provided the gift of salvation by making Jesus’s sacrificial death effective in atoning for their sin guilt. Thus, baptism becomes the first occasion in which one is assured of the gift of salvation through the means of Jesus’s atoning death. While baptism as the culmination of the conversion process this is the ideal scenario, if somehow a new Christian is not baptized, then as soon as he learns that we are commanded to do so, he should be baptized.

In addition, full immersion in water symbolizes and connects us with Christ's death, burial, resurrection, and their atoning benefits for us:

* Going into the water the believer remembers the old guilty self that justly deserved death and the pain and suffering of Christ as our representative and substitute on the cross.

* Under the water the believer associates Christ's death with his own dying to sin and his own death penalty being paid and being cleared of all guilt before God.

* Emerging from the water symbolizes Christ's resurrection to new life and the believer associates it with his own spiritual new life in Christ as a regenerated, redeemed, forgiven, loved, and adopted child of God.

!!!
    Do you not know that we who were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into His death?   ​Therefore we were buried with Him by baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.
    - Rom 6:3-4 MEV

!!!
    And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He has resurrected together with Him, having forgiven you all sins.
    - Col 2:12 MEV

### Baptism by Full Immersion

![](BaptismFullImmersion.jpg style="float: right; width: 11rem")

There are several compelling reasons to practice baptism by full immersion:

**Meaning of the Greek Word:** The New Testament term "βαπτίζω" (baptizo) means "to immerse," "to submerge," or "to dip."  It was used in various contexts, such as the sinking of a ship, the dyeing of a garment (where the cloth is completely dipped into dye), or the drawing of water by dipping a vessel. All of those result in the object of baptizo being fully submerged.

**Symbolism Alignment:** The symbolism of being buried with Christ (Romans 6:3) resonates most meaningfully when the believer is fully submerged.

**Jesus' Example:** Jesus Himself was baptized by full immersion in the Jordan River.

!!!
    9 In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.   10 ​Coming up out of the water, He immediately saw the heavens opened and the Spirit descending on Him like a dove.
    - Mark 1:9-10 MEV

**New Testament Practice**: Other New Testament accounts of Baptisms were rivers when a carafe of water was closer and easier to use, but nonetheless the baptism was in a river, suggesting that it was by full immersion.

!!!
    The whole region of Judea and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him [John the Baptist] and were all baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
    
    - Mark 1:5

!!!
    John also was baptizing in Aenon toward Salim, because much water was there. And people came and were baptized.

    - John 3:23

!!!
    36 ​As they went on their way, they came to some water. And the eunuch said, “Look, here is water. What hinders me from being baptized?”   ​37 Philip said, “If you believe with all your heart, you may.” He answered, “I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.”   38 ​And he commanded the chariot to halt. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and he baptized him.

    - Acts 8:36-38

**Humbling submission:** Baptism as an act of humble submission to God is more profound when it involves full immersion.

**Personal Experience:** For many believers, full immersion provides a more impactful and tangible experience, symbolizing a deep spiritual transformation.

## The Significance of Baptism for Believers

![](BaptismSiginificance.jpg style="float: right; width: 11rem")

Baptism is a commanded practice for Christians, as explicitly stated in Matthew 28:19. There is no biblical directive to delay or avoid baptism. Hence, it is universally commanded for Christians and often a prerequisite for church membership.

!!!
    Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
    - Mat 28:19 MEV

The act of submitting to Baptism demonstrates publicly to witnesses, as well as to the new believer himself, that the mental commitment to obedient faith in Christ as Lord and Savior is now paired with acting out of this new faith in living in obedience to Christ's commands.

In addition, for Jewish converts, Baptism into Christ carried significant social consequences, as it could result in expulsion from the Jewish temple and the religious community. Similar consequences still result in many non-Western cultures today - in Islam, the consequence is the death penalty.

## Baptism At the Time of Committing to Christ

![](BaptismTiming.jpg style="float: right; width: 11rem")

Baptism should be administered at the time an individual commits to Christ. It is a significant and memorable way to publicly mark that one's faith has developed enough to be put into practice, starting a lifelong journey to follow Jesus.

Several New Testament examples illustrate the practice of baptizing new believers immediately after they commit to Christ:

**The Day of Pentecost (Acts 2:41):** About three thousand people believed and were baptized following Peter's sermon.

!!!
    Then those who gladly received his word were baptized, and that day about three thousand souls were added to them.

    - Acts 2:41 MEV

**The Ethiopian Eunuch (Acts 8:36-38):** Philip shared the gospel with an Ethiopian eunuch. Upon understanding and accepting the message, the eunuch requested to be baptized. Philip confirmed the sincerity of his belief and then baptized him.

!!!
    ​As they went on their way, they came to some water. And the eunuch said, “Look, here is water. What hinders me from being baptized?”   ​Philip said, “If you believe with all your heart, you may.” He answered, “I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.”   ​And he commanded the chariot to halt. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and he baptized him.

    -Acts 8:36-38 MEV

**The Conversion of Saul/Paul (Acts 9:1-18):** Saul, later known as Paul, experienced a dramatic conversion on the road to Damascus. After being blinded he trusted and followed Jesus's command and then was visited by Ananias, who laid hands on him, Saul regained his sight and was baptized immediately after.

!!!
    Immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he could see again. And he rose up and was baptized.

    - Acts 9:18 MEV

**Cornelius and His Household (Acts 10:44-48):** Cornelius, a Roman centurion, and his household heard the gospel preached by Peter. They received the Holy Spirit, and Peter commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.

!!!
    47 “Can anyone forbid water for baptizing these, who have received the Holy Spirit as we have?”   48 ​So he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. [...]

    - Acts 10:47-48 MEV

**Lydia and Her Household (Acts 16:14-15):** Lydia, a seller of purple cloth in Philippi, heard Paul’s message, believed and was baptized along with her household.

!!!
    14 ​A woman named Lydia, a seller of purple fabric of the city of Thyatira, who worshipped God, heard us. The Lord opened her heart to acknowledge what Paul said.   15 ​When she and her household were baptized, she entreated us, saying, “If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and remain there.” And she persuaded us.

    - Acts 16:14-15 MEV

**The Philippian Jailer and His Family (Acts 16:30-33):** After an earthquake freed Paul and Silas from prison, the Philippian jailer asked them what he must do to be saved. They shared the gospel with him, and he and all his family were baptized.

!!!
    30 He then led them out and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”   ​31 They said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you and your household will be saved.”   32 ​And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his household.   33 ​In that hour of the night he took them and washed their wounds. And immediately he and his entire household were baptized.
    
    - Acts 16:30-33 MEV

## Delayed / Missed Baptism

Believer's baptism is a commandment for all Christians. However, since some churches baptize infants, or have otherwise faulty doctrine, a person might come to Christ without understanding the believer's baptism requirement. As soon as that misunderstanding is cleared up, the Christian should be baptized. There is no biblical justification for refusing baptism or delaying it indefinately.


## Considering Rebaptism

![](BaptismRepeated.jpg style="float: right; width: 11rem")

Rebaptism may be considered for those uncertain about their initial baptism due to lack of memory, coercion, or a previous lack of genuine faith. However, rebaptism is not necessary for those who have sinned post-baptism but rather, repentance and seeking forgiveness are advised (Acts 8:14-24).

!!!
    14 Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that **Samaria had received the word of God**, they sent Peter and John to them.   15 ​When they came down, they prayed for them that they **might receive the Holy Spirit**,   ​16 **for still He had come on none of them. They were only baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus**.   17 ​Then **they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit**.
    
    18 ​When Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,   ​saying, “Give me also this power, that whomever I lay hands on may receive the Holy Spirit.”
    
    20 ​Peter said to him, “May your money perish with you because you thought you could purchase the gift of God with money!   21 ​You have neither part nor share in this matter, for your heart is not right before God.   22 ​Therefore repent of your wickedness, and ask God if perhaps the intention of your heart may be forgiven you.   ​23 For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.”
    
    24 ​Then Simon answered, “Pray to the Lord for me that nothing you have spoken may come upon me.”

    - Acts 8:14-24 MEV

## Baptism as a Unifying Force Among Believers

![](BaptismUnifying.jpg style="float: right; width: 11rem")

Emphasizing unity in the Christian faith, baptism is a shared experience among believers (Ephesians 4:5). We advocate for unity and understanding in baptismal practices, underlining the importance of God's truth and the unity it brings (John 17:20-23).

Baptism acts as a unifying experience among Christians, as emphasized in Ephesians 4:5. It fosters unity and understanding in baptismal practices, underscoring the significance of God's truth and the unity it imparts among believers (John 17:20-23).

!!!
    2 ​With all humility, meekness, and patience, bearing with one another in love,   ​3 be eager to **keep the unity** of the Spirit in **the bond of peace**.   4 ​There is one body and one Spirit, even as you were called in one hope of your calling,   5 ​one Lord, one faith, **one baptism**,   6 ​one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.

    - Ephesians 4:2-6 MEV

!!!
    20 ​“I do not pray for these alone, but also for those who will believe in Me through their word,   21 ​that **they may all be one**, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You. May **they also be one in Us**, that the world may believe that You have sent Me.   22 ​I have given them the glory which You gave Me, that **they may be one** even as We are one:   23 ​I in them and You in Me, that **they may be perfect in unity**, and that the world may know that You have sent Me, and have loved them as You have loved Me.

    - John 17:20-23 MEV

## No State of Limbo between Belief and Baptism

![](BaptismWorksSalvation.jpg style="float: right; width: 11rem")

What if someone heard the gospel preached, centered on our sinfulness, need for repentance and Jesus being our substitute and representative in His death, burial and resurrection through which we are granted salvation - but without emphasis on the need to be baptized - and based on that commit his life to Jesus and to accept Him as Lord and Savior? Of course, we should rectify the missing understanding of the need to be baptized, but until that is accomplished or if that never happens, what is the state of such a person?

Two famous examples of this are Billy Graham and C.S.Lewis. Graham was a believer for about a month before he was baptized by full immersion, and Lewis was never baptized after coming to faith. In both cases, the preacher and the new convert were sincere and willing to trust and follow Jesus but did not understand the importance of Baptism as explained in this document up to here.

The answer depends on whether baptism is #1 a **necessary requirement** for salvation or #4 a **consequence of salvation**. If the former, then the un-baptized are not saved and, if the latter, then the un-baptized are saved as long as they are true believers in Christ.

In between there are two more options, namely that #2 **only God knows**, or that #3 **God allows exceptions to the rule of necessary requirement**.

* The two views at the extremes, #1 and #4, each have verses that support them. We will analyze them in detail in the next section.

* #2 **Only God knows:** Since there is no explicit teaching in the Bible about what happens in this case, this view leaves the determination of the state of the salvation of those individuals to God. God has the authority and ability to apply Jesus's sacrifice to these believers as He sees fit. But He is not obligated to reveal or explain to us what he does.

... This view is a last resort if indeed we cannot determine from the entire Bible if any of the other views is correct. Since it argues from silence its support is how much you disagree with the remainder of this essay that makes the case that the Bible does tell us enough to understand God's plan in this context.

* #3 **God allows exceptions to the rule of necessary requirement:** This view argues that the normal path to salvation must include baptism, but that this is a rule only for man to follow. God is not bound to this rule and can choose to save whomever He wants based on whatever criteria He wants. One would be free to choose to believe that Graham and Lewis were saved because God graciously made an exception. But this would be based merely on God's loving character and not any specific scripture backing this up.

... This view, just as #2 is a last resort and essentially is the optimistic version of #2. So again, this essay advocates that the Bible is not that vague and we can actually choose either #1 or #4 over this view.

Next we will have a closer look at #1 and #4.

## Baptism: Necessary Requirement For or Consequence Of Salvation

There is a difference between things we must do as Christians because we are commanded to, vs things that are necessary for us to be saved. Only the latter are salvation requirements set by God. For example, consider the great commission:

#### Matthew 28:19-20 The Great Commission

!!!
    19 Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 
     20 teaching them to observe all things I have commanded you. [...]

Here we are commanded to make disciples, which includes sharing the Gospel and helping others to come to saving faith, baptize, teach to obey. Or as a compact formula: **belief + baptism + good works = salvation**. The three components are commanded, and the result of having all three is to be saved. However, from the wider context of the Bible, we know that even though the good works part is commanded, it is not a requirement for salvation, instead it is a consequence of salvation. It is a consequence, because of happiness to be forgiven and commitment to be obedient to Christ, we want to do good works and will do so.

A similar question can be asked about the **+ baptism** part. It is also commanded, but is it a **necessary requirement for salvation** or a **consequence of salvation**?. While some passages in the Bible, such as Acts 2:38, are sometimes interpreted as baptism is necessary for the forgiveness of sins, receiving the Holy Spirit, and salvation, other passages emphasize that salvation is by faith-alone. Note that faith-alone here does not mean a merely mental ascend to believe in Christ without a commitment to being obedient resulting in changed behavior. To avoid association of faith-alone with faith-without-obedience, we will call this view **obedient-faith**.  

This apparent contradiction between requirement vs consequence poses a challenge in understanding the role of baptism in the salvation process.

![](JustificationAndSanctification.jpg)

The Justification and Sanctification chart depicts the order of events over time, all of which are required for the normal progression to become a mature Christian. Both views agree on all of the parts, but disagree on where along the timeline we associate the act of God to save the repentant sinner. The earlier green time point is after having faith in Christ as Lord and savior. This is the **obedient-faith** interpretation. And in blue is the **baptism-completes-faith** interpretation with the time of salvation moved to coincide with baptism.

Both views share that faith for Jesus has two components, *that* and *in*. Belief must start with *faith that* Jesus is divine, died, was buried, rose and is alive today. Belief must then include *repentance*, the realization that I have personally broken God's law, am under just condemnation and cannot redeem myself but am at the mercy of Jesus to pay for my sin guilt. Finally, this repentance leads to *faith in* Christ that He indeed chose to apply His sacrificial death payment to my sin account and that in return I will make him my Lord to whom I will pledge allegiance and whose commands I will follow. This commitment to follow Christ's commands is what makes this faith obedient faith.

Furthermore, both views agree that baptism is the expected first step of obedience to Christ as our Lord. No Christian is exempted from this command.  And since baptism ought to be right away, it is part of the conversion process of becoming a Christian.

A fully justified Christian then is confident of his salvation and begins the process of sanctification, where as a consequence of knowing that we are saved we are eager to do be obedient to all of God's commands, do good works, make disciples and teach doctrine, just as the great commission commands us to. The expectation is that this sanctification process will be a bumpy road with some setbacks, but overall God is working in us and we with him to understand Him better and live increasingly according to His rule and guidance.

The key distinction is where the act of God to save us is placed, meaning when our sins are paid for and we are indwelled with the Holy Spirit. Still shared in both views is that this happens when we have true, obedient faith that + in Jesus as our Lord and Savior. However, in the **baptism completes faith** view this level of saving faith can only be reached during the baptism, while in the **obedient faith** view saving faith is reached before baptism and becomes the reason why we choose to be baptized. Note that there is a subtle but important difference between the commintment to be obedient and a track record of obedient actions.  Obedient actions demonstrate that the person is obedient. But a person can be obedient with no actions to show for after the mental commitment to be obedient, but before the first opportunity to act it out. The two views differ in recognizing this differentiation.

... in other words:

**Baptism-completes-faith (necessary requirement):** In this view baptism is the **occasion** at which Jesus' atoning death, **the means of salvation**, is applied to the believer's life. It is not the act of baptism itself that saves, nor the the faith in Jesus that it represents, but both in unison trigger God choosing to apply Jesus' sacrificial death to clear our sin guilt. Baptism completes the process of coming to faith and only during the baptism can this faith be called obedient faith. It sees baptism as a first step of obedience that is part of the salvation process, but not a work that merits salvation. This is similar to not counting as works making a commitment to Christ or praying a prayer.

**obedient-faith (baptism is consequence of salvation):** In this view when we have true, obedient faith that Jesus is divine, died, was buried, rose and is alive today; we acknowledge and repent of our sin; trust in Jesus as our Savior to atone for our sin guilt; and finally commit to make Him our Lord and follow His commands - then God applies Jesus' sacrificial death to clear our sin guilt and we are indwelled with the Holy Spirit.  Consequently, we are changed and motivated to demonstrate our obedience to Christ through being baptized. Hence, the decision to be baptized is a consequence of salvation. Note that the refusal to be baptized is a good reason to question the sincerity of belief and commitment to Christ and by extension it puts the state of salvation into question.

#### Roadmap

We first offer a *statement of the challenges* and then an *assessment of the challenges* to each view, and then go verse by verse to see how those challenges are grounded in the Bible, organized into three groups of verses.

The first group is in the section on *water vs spirit baptism*, where we see that none of the examples of baptisms in the New Testament have spirit baptism at the same time as water baptism.

Next, in the section *Emphasis on Faith*, we see that salvation is also taught in be Bible without any mention of baptism, which resonates easily with the obedient-faith view but is harder explained on the baptism-completes-faith view.

Finally, we look at several passages in the New Testament that *emphasize baptism* and are often used as justification for the baptism-completes-faith view. However, as we will see, these passages can be interpreted as obedient-faith as well without having to resort to contrived explanations. Nonetheless, they do make a strong case for the importance of baptism as a command that should be obeyed and not delayed.

Now let's turn to the *challenges "in principle"* so we can have the difficulties of both views in mind when studying the individual verses.

#### Statement of challenges

To maintain the *baptism-completes-faith* view, that makes *baptism a necessary condition for salvation*, one needs to make these stretches in interpretation:

* The teaching verses that link salvation to faith alone must imply the other requirements including baptism. These requirements are not mentioned due to irrelevance but for brevity, and they are assumed to be included implicitly.
* Being regenerated and being made spiritually alive and given our new soft heart during the baptism means that before the baptism we are still unsaved, spiritually dead persons who do not desire to please God. This view must maintain that nonetheless we are able to commit to being baptized which is an act that pleases God.
* The accounts in Acts where the timing of baptism and receiving the Holy Spirit are recorded and are never coincident must be considered exceptions to the rule. Even though there are no explicit examples that align with the rule, the rule still holds, as it is derived from teaching verses rather than historical account verses.

The *obedient-faith view*, that makes *baptism sufficient condition for salation*, but *not a necessarry one*, needs to make these stretches in interpretation:

* The teaching verses where baptism is linked to salvation need to imply obedient faith and/or have only sympolic meaning and not describe the saving act at the moment of baptism.

#### Assessment of challenges

In comparison, there are fewer and less challenging hurdles for the faith-alone view than the baptism-completes-faith view.

Both perspectives must **assume unstated conditions are implied**, but the reasonableness of these assumptions differs significantly. It is clear that sincerely deciding to be baptized implies having obedient faith. However, having some faith does not as clearly imply a desire to be baptized. Baptism marks the end of the conversion process, which begins with faith in God's existence and authority. This is followed by conviction of our sin guilt, repentance for our sins, faith in Jesus as savior, faith in Jesus as Lord to whom we are accountable, decisions on how to act differently, and then the decision to be baptized, culminating in the actual baptism. Faith produces all these steps, and each one is a sufficient condition for the ones before it. However, they are not all instantaneous. We take time to progress through the stages. **The question is where along the progression the state of saving faith is reached**. Proposing that it is only reached during the act of baptism is more of a stretch than placing it before the decision to be baptized.

Furthermore, regarding the *reasonableness of assuming unstated conditions*, this progression over time shows the asymmetry between the two needed assumptions. *Obedient-Faith* assumes that earlier steps have already happened, which is reasonable. But *baptism-completes-faith* must assume that when the first step is mentioned, all of the later steps have also already occurred. That is much less reasonable - especially when the verse is not talking about mature Christians, but telling us what the requirement for salvation is.

Asserting that faith produces repentance, trust in Christ and the desire to be baptized without being saving faith and then, **durnig the baptism, that faith is upgraded to saving faith,** is a contrived explanation that has no scripture backing it up, but it is needed to maintain consistency of the baptism-completes-faith view.

The issue for baptism-completes-faith that all given examples of baptisms are **exceptions** to the rule** is also hard to explain away.  The typical explanation offered is that those were special occasions because they were the first time when a special category of people became a Christian, such as the apostles, gentiles, samarians, etc. But especially in the inaugural event, the one that sets the example to follow, the rule should be demonstrated, not broken. And if the rule was broken in all inaugural events, then it seriously puts into question if there is such a rule.

It is completely fine to see the baptism as an event that strengthens our faith. Throughout the sanctification process, as we mature as Chrisitans, there will be many things that strengthen our faith, and our baptism may very well be the event that increases our faith more significantly than anything else afterward. Nonetheless, that does not mean, that our faith is insufficient to be saving faith before the baptism. Initially, it just has to be the size of a mustard seed to be effective, and it can grow into something much larger over time.

Matthew 13:31-32

!!!
    31 He put another parable before them, saying, “The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field. 32 It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches.”

Next, let's see how these assessments resonate with scripture.

### Spirit Baptism vs Water Baptism

**Spirit Baptism**: A new believer receiving the Holy Spirit to permanently indwell, guide, support, convict, and help him.

#### Romans 8:9 Spirit in you yes/no => belong to Christ yes/no

!!!
    9 You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you. Now if any man does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him. <sub>-MEV</sub>

Having the Holy Spirit means we belong the Christ which means we are regenerated, saved Christians who are no longer condemned.

<!-- #### John 3:18 Condemnation yes/no => belief yes/no

Belief in Christ means not being condemned, which means regenerated, saved Christians who are indwelled by the Holy Spirit. -->

As we see next, the New Testament passages that document various baptisms never report the timing of spirit baptism to coincide with the timing of water baptism.

#### Acts 9:17-19 Holy Spirit for Paul before water baptism

!!!
    17 So Ananias left and entered the house. Then he placed his hands on him and said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road you were traveling, has sent me so that you can regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”
    18 At once something like scales fell from his eyes, and he regained his sight. Then he got up and was baptized. 19 And after taking some food, he regained his strength.

* *obedient-faith:* The laying on of hands and prayer was for being filled with the Holy Spirit. After that was accomplished Paul was baptized. Hence, the Holy Spirit was not received during water baptism - fitting with obedient-faith, not baptism-completes-faith.

* *baptism-completes-faith:* this is an exception to the rule. However, at least it demonstrates that the new believer should be baptized right away.

#### Acts 10:44-48: Holy Spirit for Cornelius before water baptism

In Acts 10:1-33 Cornelius is described as gentile that is very eager to hear the gospel. And in verses 34-43 Peter preaches the gospel. Then comes 44ff:

!!!
    44  While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word.   45 All the believers of the circumcision who had come with Peter were astonished because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles.   46  For they heard them speaking in other tongues and magnifying God. Then Peter continued,   47 “Can anyone forbid water for baptizing these, who have received the Holy Spirit as we have?”   48 So he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they asked him to stay a few days.

Here we have 1) hearing and believing the gospel, 2) being filled with the Holy Spirit, and 3) being baptized.

* *obedient-faith:* sees this as a typical salvation account where baptism was right after coming to believe and being filled with the Holy Spirit. Hence, the Holy Spirit was not received during water baptism - fitting with faith-alone, not baptism-completes-faith. Note that we must read between the lines to interpret Cornelius's belief as obedient faith, but based on the context this is reasonable.

* *baptism-completes-faith:* this is an exception to the rule. However, at least it demonstrates that the new believer should be baptized right away.
  
#### Acts 18:24-28 Apollos, believer + ferverent in the spirit, taught about water baptism, but not baptized

!!!
    A Jew named Apollos, a native Alexandrian, an eloquent man who was powerful in the use of the Scriptures, arrived in Ephesus. This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught the things about Jesus accurately, although **he knew only John’s baptism**. He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. After Priscilla and Aquila heard him, **they took him home and explained the way of God to him more accurately**. When he wanted to cross over to Achaia, the brothers wrote to the disciples urging them to welcome him. After he arrived, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace. For he vigorously refuted the Jews in public, demonstrating through the Scriptures that Jesus is the Messiah.

* *obedient-faith:* since Apollos was already a strong believer and filled with the Holy Spirit, Priscilla and Aquila did not see a need for him to be baptized in the name of Jesus, however they explained it to him. -- A little strange that they did not insist he needed to be baptized in Jesus name, but at least it makes clear that it was not a salvation issue for Priscilla and Aquila. -- Or they did baptize him in the name of Jesus, but Luke did not see it as important enough to include in his writing, again matching better with obedient-faith than baptism-completes-faith.

* *baptism-completes-faith:* this is also an exception to the rule. Possibly Apollos was baptized in Jesus name by Priscilla and Aquila, but it was simply not recorded in this passage. *... Although it seems that after pointing out that Apollo knew only the baptism of John and his knowledge being corrected it would be quite fitting to report that he then was baptized in Jesus name if that really happened.*

#### Acts 19:1-7 Holy Spirit received in Corinth not during water baptism but after

!!!
    1​ While Apollos was in Corinth, Paul traveled through the interior regions and came to Ephesus. He found some disciples  2 and asked them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?”
  “No,” they told him, “we haven’t even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.”
    3 “Then what baptism were you baptized with?” he asked them.
  “With John’s baptism,” they replied.
    4 Paul said, “John baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling the people that they should believe in the One who would come after him, that is, in Jesus.”
    5 When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 6 And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began to speak in other languages and to prophesy. 7 Now there were about 12 men in all.

These disciples of Christ believed but did not have the Holy Spirit and only had John's baptism. Paul baptized them in Jesus name and they still did not have the Holy Spirit. It was given only after a subsequent laying of hands on them by Paul.

* *obedient-faith:* This passage describes both, water baptism in Jesus name and receiving of the Holy Spirit, and they are not happening at the same time, resonating with obedient-faith, not baptism-completes-faith. Still, it is a strange passage, as it describes the people as disciples and believers but apparently, when starting to believe it did not trigger receiving the Holy Spirit. Maybe because their belief was sincere but based on too much false or incomplete information. Then Paul corrected their confusion and after both, the baptism and the laying on of hands, their faith was firm obedient faith so the Holy Spirit was given.

* *baptism-completes-faith:* this is also an exception to the rule. However, at least it demonstrates that the new believer should be baptized right away.

#### Acts 8:14-17 Holy Spirit received in Samaria not during water baptism but after

!!!
    14 When the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had welcomed God’s message, they sent Peter and John to them. 15 After they went down there, they prayed for them, so the Samaritans might receive the Holy Spirit. 16 For He had not yet come down on any of them; they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 17 Then Peter and John laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.

* *obedient-faith:* This passage describes both, water baptism in Jesus's name and receiving of the Holy Spirit, and they are not happening at the same time, resonating with obedient-faith, not baptism-completes-faith. Still, it is a strange passage, as it describes the people as believers that received the proper water baptism in Jesus's name but apparently, this did not trigger receiving the Holy Spirit. Maybe because their belief was still plagued by doubt and or missing information. Then Peter and John preached to them and during the laying on of hands, their faith was firm obedient faith so the Holy Spirit was given.

* *baptism-completes-faith:* this is also an exception to the rule. However, at least it demonstrates that the new believer should be baptized right away.

#### Conclusion of Spirit Baptism vs Water Baptism

There is not even one report in Acts in which the Holy Spirit was given during water baptism. Still, when both are reported they are very close in time. So new believers always were baptized right away. That is a pattern we should continue today. Nonetheless, the timing of receiving the Holy Spirit is not linked to baptism, but to the start of having firm obedient faith in Jesus as Lord and Savior. Hence obedient-faith is a better match than baptism-completes-faith.

### Emphasis on Faith

#### John 3:16 Belief leads to eternal life

!!!
    “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.

    - John 3:16

* *obedient-faith:* This states the conditions for salvation. If water baptism was one of them it should be mentioned, but is not.
* *baptism-completes-faith:* the baptism requirement is instituted by Jesus at the great commission, which was given after John 3:16 *... but should that make John 3:16 obsolete or even contradict it?* ... OR
* *baptism-completes-faith:* any mention of faith alone leading to salvation implies the other requirements including baptism. So they are not left out because of irrelevance, but for brevity and are assumed to be included implicitly. *... - acceptable but a less straight forward match to scripture than the obedient-faith view.*

#### 1 Corinthians 15:1-8

!!!
    1  Now, brothers, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which you have received, and in which you stand.   2  Through it you are saved, if you keep in memory what I preached to you unless you have believed in vain.  3  For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: how Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,   4  was buried, rose again the third day according to the Scriptures,   5  and was seen by Cephas, and then by the twelve.   6  Then He was seen by over five hundred brothers at once, of whom the greater part remain to this present time, though some have passed away.   7  Then He was seen by James and then by all the apostles.   8  Last of all, He was seen by me also, as by one born at the wrong time.

* *obedient-faith:* This is one of the most clear statements of the conditions for salvation. If water baptism was one of them it should be mentioned, but is not.
* *baptism-completes-faith:* If Paul was trying to state just the conditions for salvation, then he should not have included in the same sentence the various post-resurrection appearances, which are not essential to salvation. Instead, Paul gives a listing of shared Christian core beliefs that Paul assumed everyone knew to emphasize that he's not telling them new stuff, only already established truths. And with that context, it does not matter that he left out repentance and left out baptism - it's simply not a text focusing on requirements for salvation. ... - But Paul states in verse 1 explictly that what follows is the gospel, so it must contain everything that is needed for salvation. ...  OR
* *baptism-completes-faith:* any mention of faith alone leading to salvation implies the other requirements including baptism. So they are not left out because of irrelevance, but for brevity and are assumed to be included implicitly. *... acceptable but a less straight forward match to scripture than the obedient-faith view.*

#### 1 Corinthians 1:14,17: Paul on baptism

!!!
    14 I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius, 15 [...] 16 [...]

    17 For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to evangelize [...]

    - 1 Corinthians 1:14,17

In this passage, Paul is arguing against the divisions that plagued the Corinthian church.

* *obedient-faith:* If baptism was necessary for salvation, why did Paul say he was thankful he baptized so few people? Why did he say that he was *not* sent to baptize? If baptism was necessary for salvation, Paul essentially said, “I am thankful I saved so few ...” and “For Christ did not send me to save ...”. That would be an unbelievably ridiculous statement for Paul to make. (See https://www.gotquestions.org/baptism-salvation.html )

* *baptism-completes-faith:* One verse earlier Paul asks rhetorically if they were baptized in the name of Paul. That implies that he knew they were all baptized in the name of Jesus, meaning they were all water baptized. He did not conduct the baptisms, but he's not saying that baptism is not needed. It seems that when he was with that church, there were some faithful leaders that he was comfortable leaving the baptisms to, so he could focus on the more difficult task of evangelizing and teaching. *... - acceptable but a less straight forward match to scripture than the obedient-faith view.*

#### Ephesians 2:8-9

!!!
    8  For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not of yourselves. It is the gift of God,   9  not of works, so that no one should boast.   10  For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we should walk in them.

This teaches that salvation is just through faith.

* *obedient-faith:* Adding any works, incl. demonstrating obedience in water baptism, would make it no longer just faith. Thus water baptism is not a requirement.

* *baptism-completes-faith:* even obedient-faith teaches that salvation is not unilaterally forced upon by God, but requires a to-do list for the believer: mental comprehension of the gospel, belief that it's true, repentance, trusting Jesus, committing to follow Him, accepting the gift of salvation. Those are not trivial but are still classified as not-works. This view simply includes baptism into that do-do list and also classifies it as not-works. And all of those items are things that either exalt Jesus or humble ourselves. Not things that can be used to boast about ourselves. And that's the main concern of this verse: we ought to not think we earned our salvation or did something that makes us deserve it and that consequently we could boast about. *... acceptable, but less straigt forward than the obedient-faith view. Note also, that the obedient-faith steps are all mental, while baptism is a physical act and thus more inherently associated with works.*

* *obedient-faith:* Even if we accept that baptism is not a works, then this verse still states that the requirements to be saved do not include baptism.

* *baptism-completes-faith:* any mention of faith alone leading to salvation implies the other requirements including baptism. So they are not left out because of irrelevance, but for brevity and are assumed to be included implicitly. *... acceptable but less straight forward than the obedient-faith view.*

#### Titus 3:5

!!!
    5  not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of rebirth and the renewal of the Holy Spirit,

This teaches that salvation is not by works, but an undeserved gift from God.

* *obedient-faith:* Adding any works, incl. demonstrating obedience in water baptism, would make it no longer faith-alone. Thus water baptism is not a requirement.

* *baptism-completes-faith:* same as the prior passage, baptism is humbling and not something to boast about. Hence it can be considered not-works like the other things that *faith-alone* requires for salvation. *... as in prior passage, acceptable interpretation, but less straight forward than the obedient-faith view.*

#### Hebrews 11.6: impossible to please God without faith

!!!
    5  ​And without faith it is impossible to please God, for he who comes to God must believe that He exists and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.

* *obedient-faith:* Being baptized is something we do to please God. According to this verse that is not possible to do until after we are saved.

* *baptism-completes-faith:* Having faith here does not mean saving faith, just faith in God's existence.  *... Why would belief in mere existence make me want to please? I am also believing Satan exists, that does not make me want to please him.  Only because I trust that Jesus is my Lord and Savior do I want to please him. That started when I committed to having obedient faith.*

#### Conclusion of Emphasis on Faith

We are saved by obedient faith, not by works. However, we do not need to classify being baptized as works. It is something done to us, not by us. It is a demonstration of our faith and obedience to Jesus as our Lord. Still, baptism is an act of obedience subsequent to salvation, not a necessary requirement for salvation.

### Emphasis on Baptism

#### [Acts 2:37-38,40](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2%3A37-40&version=MEV): Repent and be baptized for the forgiveness of sin and receiving the Holy Spirit

!!!
    37 When they heard this, **they were stung in the heart** and said to Peter and to the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, **what shall we do?**”

    38 Peter said to them, “**Repent and be baptized**, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for **the forgiveness of sins**, and you shall **receive the gift of the Holy Spirit**.   39 [...]

    40 **With many other words** he testified and exhorted them, saying, “Be saved from this perverse generation.”

    - Acts 2:37-38,40 MEV

Acts 2:38 correlates repentance and baptism with salvation (forgiveness of sins and receiving the Holy Spirit). While it teaches that the package of both, repentance and baptism are required parts of the conversion process, it does not tell us if both are necessary conditions for salvation, nor does it tell us if salvation is granted during the first, the second or before or after.

* *obedient-faith:* Repenting implies having faith. The receiving of the Holy Spirit happens when we start to have firm obedient faith in Jesus as our Lord and Savior, which typically is before water baptism.

* *baptism-completes-faith:* this passage directly ties water baptism to receiving the Holy Spirit. It is possible that it is implied that the Holy Spirit is received during the water baptism. *... during baptism is possible, but so is before or after. This is too vague to be acceptable as an example for receiving the Holy Spirit during baptism.*

Acts 2:38 is the nearest example in the entire Bible to the Holy Spirit being received during baptism. However, it does not explicitly state this. Inferring that the receiving occurs at the time of baptism is an interpretation that requires reading between the lines. Similarly, identifying it with the time of coming to obedient faith is another interpretation matching this verse based on reading between the lines. Both interpretations are consistent with this single verse. To determine the correct one, it is necessary to consider the wider context of the Bible.

If we paraphrase this verse at a baptism to become

* *"I baptize you in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; for the forgiveness of sins and to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit"*
 
then we shift the apparent meaning such that baptism becomes the means of salvation. We should choose a phrase that does not run that risk of misunderstanding. Two options are:

* *"I baptize you in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit"* or
* *"Based on your confession, repentance from your sins, and commitment to obediently follow Jesus, I baptize you in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; assuring you of your forgiveness of sins and your gift of the Holy Spirit"*

#### [Mark 16:16] (https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark+16%3A16&version=MEV) Belief and Baptism saves

!!!
    “He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned”.

    - Mark 16:16

This verse clearly states that the combination of belief and baptism leads to salvation. The second half of the verse is equally clear that without faith man is condemned.

What is not clear is the state of those who believe but are not baptized.

* *obedient-faith:* based on other verses, un-baptized obedient faith believers are saved as well.

* *baptism-completes-faith:* un-baptized believers are the exception. Anyone who truly believes will want to be baptized right away and deepen his faith through the process of baptism. So there is only a very brief window of being fully committed to Christ and not yet being baptized. God will accept people who die in that state into heaven based on their beliefs. Nonetheless, this exception does not eliminate the rule/command to be baptized at the time of trusting Jesus, nor does it diminish the effect of the baptism deepening the trust and commitment. *... that sounds nice, but is inconsistent with the principle of baptism being a necessary requirement for salvation. It effectively makes baptism optional.* **???Should that really be the baptism-completes-faith interpretation of this verse???**

#### [1 Peter 3:21](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1 Pet 3.21)

!!!
    Figuratively this is like **baptism, which also saves us now**. It is not washing off the dirt from the body, but a response to God **from a good conscience through the resurrection of Jesus Christ**,

    - 1 Peter 3:21 MEV

* *obedient-faith:* Here the second part of the verse is to clarify the meaning of the first, namely that the significance of the baptism is not the "washing of the dirt" (the physical action of baptism) but "a response to God from a good conscience", meaning the conscience is already good before the baptisms starts. This implies that it must be after one's sins are forgiven and salvation has been received. Thus, baptism cannot be a prerequisite for salvation. See [gotquestions.org/baptism-1Peter-3-21](https://www.gotquestions.org/baptism-1Peter-3-21.html)

* *baptism-completes-faith:* baptism saves us *now*. Clearly, salvation is granted during the baptism. Therefore, the good conscience is also being given/cleansed during the baptism. *... but "is a response from x" implies that x existed before the response that it produced. So the conscience must have been cleared before the baptism.*

An analogy might be that *obedient-faith* sees passing the driver's license test as "getting your license" while *baptism-completes-faith* sees it as being handed your driver's license card. The qualification and the receiving of the actual card are part of the process for both, but the emphasis and significance are different.

#### [Acts 22:16](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Acts 22.16)

!!!
    "And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized, and wash your sins away, calling on his name."

    - Acts 22:16

* *baptism-completes-faith:* here we have trusting Jesus, baptism and forgiveness of sins combined, just as it fits with a new believer that at the time of trusting Jesus is being baptized and saved.

* *obedient-faith:* This verse does not say that being baptized is what washes the sins away. It states two different commands: 1) baptism, 2) washing one's sins, to be done through "calling on His name" which means by believing in Christ. See [gotquestions.org/baptism-Acts-22-16](https://www.gotquestions.org/baptism-Acts-22-16.html)

#### [Galatians 3:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3%3A27&version=MEV)

!!!
    27 For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.

* *baptism-completes-faith:* baptism is equated with putting on Christ. Fits naturally with this view. ... This is an equating of people counts, not timnig - if the putting on Christ was before the batism, it would fit with this verse.

* *obedient-faith:* Baptism here can be seen as baptism by the Holy Spirit, not by water. Thus it does not teach that baptism by water is a requirement for salvation.
* Alternatively, if baptism is understood as a believer's water baptism, then everyone that was baptized also believed. And as such it is true that they were saved, or as stated here, "put on Christ". However, not based on the baptism, but based on the underlying prior belief.
* Finally, even if it is the water baptism that is providing the being "put on Christ", then it is actually obvious that this is not literal but symbolic. And a symbolic association happens after the real event already passed.
See [gotquestions.org/baptism-Galatians-3-27](https://www.gotquestions.org/baptism-Galatians-3-27.html)

#### [Romans 6:3-4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206&version=MEV)

!!!
    3 Do you not know that we who were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into His death? 4 Therefore we were buried with Him by baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.

The difficulty in this passage is to determine what is literal and what is symbolic, and when each part is happening.

**We who were baptized** is clearly literal, talking about Paul and fellow believers in his audience. And by extension, any Christian today.

**baptized** is clearly literal, as this was and continues to be a physical practice that this passage teaches about.

**into Jesus Christ** is clearly symbolic. We often say "*baptized in the name of Jesus Christ*" to make this even more obvious. Jesus is not there physically when we are baptized, so it is a symbolic connection.

**into His death** refers to Jesus's death which is His concrete physical death, but the *into* is symbolic, as our submersion in water is obviously not causing our physical death, nor that of Christ.

**we were buried** is clearly symbolic, as during our baptism we are physically alive. The similarity is that during a burial the person is fully covered with stuff (dirt) and similarly in baptism we are fully covered with stuff (water).

**with Him** is clearly symbolic, as Jesus is not there physically during our baptism.

**by baptism** is clearly literal, since this passage is about our water baptism.

***into death*** is clearly symbolic, since we are not physically dying during baptism. But it is not that clear what death symbolically stands for. In the prior verse it was *His death*, so death stood for the physical death of Christ. Here it might have that meaning again, but at most secondary. Primarily it needs to be our death which again cannot be our physical death. It also cannot be our spiritual death, since baptism is about becoming spiritually alive after having been spiritually dead earlier. In similar contexts, we often see the phrase dying to self or to the power of sin. That is most likely the death that is referenced here. However, that still leaves unresolved if this symbolical death to self/sin is a reference to something that has already happened or is happening at that moment during the baptism. This is where the interpretations differ.

**Christ was raised up** is clearly literal, as Christ was indeed raised up.

**we also should walk in newness of life** is clearly symbolic, as we are not walking during the baptism. The connection is that after Jesus was raised up, he was walking again with new life, and during the baptism, we are raised out of the water, and after the baptism, we will be walking again, but now with the confidence that we are having new spiritual life. And this implies that being raised out of the water is what symbolizes receiving new life by the analogy to Christ's resurrection.  However, that still leaves unresolved if our actual receiving of new spiritual life happens during the being raised out of the water or at some other point and here we just have the symbolic connection between the two. This is the second point at which the interpretations differ.

* *baptism-completes-faith:* we actually die to self/sin as we are submerged in water and we actually receive new life when we are raised out of the water. That this passage is loaded with symbolic meaning does not prevent it from describing concrete salvific changes happening during the baptism. This passage fits beautifully with this view.

* *obedient-faith:* There is a lot of symbolic meaning in this passage. There are many symbolic associations between the details of the baptism and those of Jesus burial and resurrection, but Jesus's burial and resurrection, that the symbolisms relate to are *not* happening at the moment of the baptism. Then there are two baptism details that symbolically relate to how God saves us. It is possible that those actions of God are happening at the same time as the baptism, but that's not clear from the text and it's quite reasonable to interpret it as having symbolic connection but not temporal identity. If it was intended to be understood as simultaneous, then it would have been easy to add a sentence to clarify that. As it stands, the inherent ambiguity should lead us to resolve the timeline from the wider context of the Bible - and that we saw earlier ties the moment of salvation to the moment of starting to have obedient faith.

#### [Romans 6:2-4, 5-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6%3A2-7&version=MEV) We have died to sin since we were baptized into Christ's death and crucified with Christ
!!!
    2 God forbid! How shall **we who died to sin** live any longer in it? 3 Do you not know that **we who were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into His death**? 4 Therefore we were buried with Him by baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.

Here baptism into Christ's death is linked to dying to sin and being freed from it.

!!!
    5 For if we have been united with Him in the likeness of His death, so shall we also be united with Him in the likeness of His resurrection, 6 knowing this, that **our old man has been crucified with Him**, so that **the body of sin might be destroyed**, and we should no **longer be slaves to sin**. 7 For **the one who has died is freed from sin**.

Here being crucified with Christ is linked to dying to sin and being freed from it.

Romans 6:2-4 and 6:5-7 are part of the same line of thought. Clearly, both have some symbolic meanings. Why should we think that the first one also teaches that during the baptism our sins are literally washed away, when right after it talks about being crucified with Christ which was not during our baptism and that also washes away our sins? It does not make sense that both, baptized into Christ and crucified with Christ are the moment at which we are saved as they are different moments in time. Picking one as symbolic and literal and the other as only symbolic is arbitrary. However, it is reasonable to see these two as both being symbolic references to the one single other event at which we were saved. And each of these symbolic references highlights a different aspect of our actual being saved event. And when that event was we need to get from the wider biblical context, but at least it's clear it needs to be prior to baptism.

#### Conclusion of Emphasis on Baptism

While baptism is not a necessary requirement for salvation - reserved solely for obedient faith in Jesus as Lord and Savior - it should be taught as the first step of obedience to Christ and the last but very important step in the process of the conversion to becoming a Christian. It gives the new believer the assurance that his faith is saving faith, that he has been regenerated, washed clear of his sin guilt, is filled with the Holy Spirit and is now a full member of the body of Christ followers.
