## Right Division

### 2 Timothy 3:16 all scripture is good
!!!
   16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: - 2 Timothy 3:16 KJV

### 2 Timothy 2:15 rightly divide scripture
!!!
   15 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, **rightly dividing** *G5114* the word of truth.- 2 Timothy 2:15 KJV

#### G5114 rightly dividing

Strong's Dictionary:

* ὀρθοτομέω orthotoméō, or-thot-om-eh'-o; from a compound of G3717 and the base of G5114, to **make a straight cut**, i.e. (figuratively) **to dissect (expound) correctly** (the divine message):—**rightly divide**.

Blue Letter Bible Definition:

* to cut straight, to cut straight ways
  * to proceed on straight paths, hold a straight course, equiv. to **doing right**
* to make straight and smooth, to handle aright, to **teach the truth directly and correctly**

Thayer's Greek Lexicon:

* [...]
* to make straight and smooth; Vulg.rectetracto, to handle aright: τόν λόγον τῆς ἀληθείας, i. e. to **teach the truth correctly and directly**, 2 Timothy 2:15; τόν ἀληθῆ λόγον, Eustathius, opuscc., p. 115, 41. (Not found elsewhere)

GPT4 Bible Commentary:

* **Accurate understanding**: Rightly dividing the Bible means interpreting the Scriptures accurately and understanding their intended meaning. This requires considering the context, historical background, cultural norms, and original languages of the text. An accurate understanding of the Bible helps believers to grow in their faith and knowledge of God.

* **Proper application**: When believers correctly interpret the Bible, they are better equipped to apply its teachings to their lives in a meaningful and relevant way. Rightly dividing the Bible helps to bridge the gap between the ancient text and modern life, allowing believers to live in accordance with God's will and purpose.

#### Properness or cutting into pieces?

The dictionary review shows two options:

* Literal: cut into two pieces along a straight line. That would mean cutting up the paper/parchment of the Bible

* Figuratively: to teach truth correctly and directly.

The context of the verse is:
##### 2 Tim 2:11-18 MEV
!!!
   11 This is a faithful saying: If we die with Him,    we shall also live with Him.
   12 If we endure,    we shall also reign with Him.   If we deny Him,    He also will deny us.
   13 If we are faithless,    He remains faithful;    He cannot deny Himself.
   14 Remind them of these things, commanding them before the Lord that they not argue about words, which leads to nothing of value and to the destruction of those who hear them. 15 Study to show yourself approved by God, a workman who need not be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. 16 But avoid profane foolish babblings, for they will increase to more ungodliness, 17 and their word will spread like gangrene: Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, 18 who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection has already occurred, and who overthrow the faith of some. 

* This is talking about proper teaching, not cutting the word into two parts. So the figurative meaning makes more sense, and we could translate rightly divide in 2:15 as "[...] a workman who need not be ashamed, teaching the word of truth correctly and directly".

## Covenants and their scope

### Heb 1:1-2 God changed revelation methods
!!!
   1 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,
   2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son,

* God changed over time how He revealed truth to us.


### Gen 15:18 covenant with Abraham
!!!
   18 In the same day the Lord made a covenant(H1285) with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:

* a covenant for Abraham and his seed [descendant, singular]

### Gen 26:3-4 covenant with Abraham now called oath, reassured to Isaac.
!!!
   3 Sojourn [remain] in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the **oath**(H7621) **which I sware unto Abraham** thy father; 
   4 And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and **in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed**; 

* the covenant with Abraham is now referred to as an oath
* the blessings are now made more specific, not only for the direct descendant, but *all the nations*.
  * that means what? Gentiles also
  * thy seed is singular, as Paul clears up in Galatians 3:16, so the seed is Jesus and in Him all the nations are blessed.

### Exodus 16:5-6
!!!
   [... tell the children on Israel ...] 5 Now therefore, if you will faithfully obey My voice and keep My covenant(H1285), then you shall be My special possession out of all the nations, for all the earth is Mine. 6 And you will be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.”

* Here it's called a covenant again and is with the children of Israel
* They will be a kingdom of priests

### Romans 4

The whole chapter is about Abraham, and that God blessed Abraham and called him righteous (Gen 15:i) not because of his works, but his belief in God. And that God did this before He made the covenant (Gen 15:18) and before Abraham was circumcised, meaning before any jew/gentile distinction. Therefore saved-because-of-faith-not-works is a principle that applies to both, Jews and Gentiles.

### Exodus 19:3 KJV
!!!
   3  And Moses went up unto God, and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to **the house of Jacob**, and tell **the children of Israel**; 

* Specifically to the children of Israel, what we now would call the Jews

### Leviticus 26:46 KJV
!!!
   46 These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the Lord made between him and the **children of Israel** in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.

* Specifically to the children of Israel, what we now would call the Jews

### Romans 2:14-15 KJV
!!!
   14  For when the **Gentiles**, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, **having not the law**, are a law unto themselves: 
   15  Which shew the work of **the law written in their hearts**, their conscience also bearing witness, and **their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing** one another;

* The Gentiles do not have the law written on paper
* The Gentiles do have the law written on their hearts, and they are judged by it.
* So both Jews and Gentiles have the same law and the same accountability, but it's given to them in different forms

### Galatians 4:4 KJV
!!!
   4  But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, 
   5  To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. 

* Jesus was born into a family under the law, in order to redeem all that were under the law
* Referring back to Romans 2:14-15 this would mean redeeming Jews and Gentiles

### The Last Supper

* There are multiple accounts in the Gospels, where Jesus is speaking directly to the Apostles. He tells them to *do this in remembrance of me*. From the Gospels it's not clear if this is supposed to be an instruction only to the men at the table or to more.
   
### 1 Corinthians 11:23-26 KJV  Last Supper restated

* Paul repeats the gospel account of the Last Supper. It's still not clear who it is to be applied to.

### 1 Corinthians 11:28-29 KJV Last Supper for any man that's worthy
!!!
   28  But let **a man examine himself**, and so **let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup**. 
   29  For he that eateth and drinketh **unworthily**, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. 

* Paul clarifies that the Last Supper tradition is for any man, as long as we examine ourselves and find us to be worthy.  From the wider context, we know this worthiness means believing in Jesus' finished work on the cross and not living as a hypocrite.


## Covenant Theology

Covenant Theology holds that God has established two great covenants with humanity:

* Covenant of Works (or Covenant of Life): This covenant is believed to have been made in the Garden of Eden between God and Adam who represented all mankind. It promised life for perfect and perpetual obedience and threatened death for disobedience. Adam, and all humanity in Adam, broke this covenant, and so death was earned.

* Covenant of Grace: After Adam's fall, God made a new covenant with all humanity, promising salvation and eternal life for all people through faith in Christ. This covenant is administered in different ways throughout the Old and New Testaments, but it is the same in substance and based entirely on God's grace to sinful people.

The key idea is that salvation has always been by faith, and it has always been faith in God's promised Messiah. This is true even in the Old Testament, prior to the coming of Jesus. People who lived before the time of Christ were saved by faith in the promised Messiah, even though they did not know the specific details about who the Messiah would be.

This idea is supported by several passages in the New Testament:

Romans 4 - Here, Paul argues that Abraham was justified (declared righteous by God) through faith, before the giving of the Law and before the rite of circumcision was instituted. Abraham believed God's promises, and it was credited to him as righteousness.

Hebrews 11 - This chapter, often referred to as the "Hall of Faith," lists many Old Testament figures who were commended for their faith. They did not receive the things promised in their lifetimes, but they saw them from afar and welcomed them.

1 Peter 1:10-12 - Peter notes that the prophets of the Old Testament prophesied about the grace that would come, searching and inquiring about the time and circumstances of the Messiah's suffering and subsequent glories. They were serving not themselves, but Christians, as they spoke of the things now announced by the Gospel.

Galatians 3:6-9, 16 - Paul says that the gospel was preached beforehand to Abraham, saying, "In you shall all the nations be blessed." Paul also argues that the promises were made to Abraham and his offspring, which he interprets as referring to Christ.

In summary, according to Covenant Theology, even though Jesus had not yet come, Old Testament believers were still saved by faith in God's promise of a future Redeemer, a promise fulfilled in Jesus Christ.
