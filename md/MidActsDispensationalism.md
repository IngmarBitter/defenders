**Mid Acts Dispensationalism**

The Gospel
==========

Mid Acts Dispensationalism (MAD): There are two gospels: 
1) the gospel of the Kingdom for Israel / the Jews, in which they are bound by the law and saved through Jesus fulfilling the law. And Matthew, Mark, Luke and John did not know anything about Jesus's death, burial and resurrection being connected to salvation.
2) the gospel of grace for the gentiles / everyone including us today, in which there is no law for us to follow, we are entirely free but are still sinners and we are saved through the belief in Jesus's death (atonement for us), burial and resurrection.

One Salvation History (OSH): There is only one gospel, one plan of salvation throughout all time:
1) man cannot redeem himself from his sin-guilt, but needs God's grace to provide a way.  And if man loves, trusts (prerequisite) and obeys (consequence) God, God applies Jesus's death as atonement for our sin guilt. And God can do that even for people without explicit knowledge of Jesus, like the Old Testament believers.  The different covenants are different expressions of the this one and only plan for salvation.

1 John 4:10 John teaches that Jesus died to atone for believers' sin-guilt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

!!!
   10 This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an **atoning sacrifice for our sins**.

OSH: John clearly was aware and even taught that Jesus died to atone for believers' sin-guilt.

MAD: This was written after the Jews failed the new covenant with God. So God terminated it, and now everyone, even the Jews are in the dispensation of grace. 
=> OSH: but then we should include the books after Philemon into those that apply to us today.
=> MAD: no, only up to Philemon is for us
=> OSH: then your initial interpretation of this verse does not make sense

Matthew 26:28 Jesus's blood is what forgives sin
------------------------------------------------

!!! 
   28 This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.

OHS: Even in the four gospels, Jesus himself teaches that His blood is what forgives our sins. That's the essence of the one and only gospel.

Questions
---------

OSH: If under grace we are not bound by any law, then how do we know if homosexuality is right or wrong?  Would it then not be the loving thing to do to affirm homosexual lifestyles?
=> MAD: ???

OSH: If under grace we are not bound by any law, then why are we still sinners? Is sin not defined as acting contrary to God's commands?
=> MAD: ???

OSH: what is grace saving us from? Is it not the just punishment according to the law?
=> MAD:

OSH: why are Gentile unbelievers going to Hell? Is it not for breaking God's law?
=> MAD:

ToDo:
* Are there examples past Acts 28 showing the law applies to Gentiles?
* Are there examples prior to Acts 28 showing grace applies to Jews?

Right Division
==============

2 Timothy 3:16 all scripture is good
------------------------------------

!!!
   16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: - 2 Timothy 3:16 KJV

2 Timothy 2:15 rightly divide scripture
---------------------------------------

!!!
   15 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, **rightly dividing** *G5114* the word of truth.- 2 Timothy 2:15 KJV

G5114 rightly dividing
---

Strong's Dictionary:

* ὀρθοτομέω orthotoméō, or-thot-om-eh'-o; from a compound of G3717 and the base of G5114, to **make a straight cut**, i.e. (figuratively) **to dissect (expound) correctly** (the divine message):—rightly divide.

Blue Letter Bible Definition:

* to **cut straight**, to cut straight ways
  * to proceed on straight paths, hold a straight course, equiv. to **doing right**
* to make straight and smooth, to handle right, to **teach the truth directly and correctly**

Thayer's Greek Lexicon:

* [...]
* to make straight and smooth; Vulg.rectetracto, to handle aright: τόν λόγον τῆς ἀληθείας, i. e. to **teach the truth correctly and directly**, 2 Timothy 2:15; τόν ἀληθῆ λόγον, Eustathius, opuscc., p. 115, 41. (Not found elsewhere)

The dictionary review shows two options:

* Literal: cut into two pieces along a straight line. That would mean cutting up the paper/parchment of the Bible

* Figuratively: to understand and teach truth correctly and directly.

2 Tim 2:11-18 MEV. The context for *rightly dividing*
-----------------------------------------------------

!!!
   11 This is a faithful saying: If we die with Him,    we shall also live with Him.

   12 If we endure,    we shall also reign with Him.   If we deny Him,    He also will deny us.

   13 If we are faithless,    He remains faithful;    He cannot deny Himself.

   14 Remind them of these things, commanding them before the Lord that they not argue about words, which leads to nothing of value and to the destruction of those who hear them. 15 Study to show yourself approved by God, a workman who need not be ashamed, **rightly dividing** the word of truth. 16 But avoid profane foolish babblings, for they will increase to more ungodliness, 17 and their word will spread like gangrene: Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, 18 who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection has already occurred, and who overthrow the faith of some. 

* This is talking about proper teaching, not cutting the word into two parts. So the figurative meaning makes more sense, and we could translate rightly divide in 2:15 as "[...] a workman who need not be ashamed, teaching the word of truth correctly and directly".
  * understanding and teaching correctly include **rightly dividing** / distinguishing** between: 
    * proper doctrine and false teaching
    * rules applicable only in the past and those applicable today
    * the way to heaven and the one to hell
    * what's morally right and wrong
    * good and evil
    * wisdom and foolishness
    * what's revealed and what's mystery
  

Covenants and their scope
=========================

Heb 1:1-2 God changed revelation methods
----------------------------------------

!!!
   1 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,
   2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son,

* God changed over time how He revealed truth to us.


Gen 15:18 covenant with Abraham
-------------------------------

!!!
   18 In the same day the Lord made a covenant(H1285) with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:

* a covenant for Abraham and his seed [descendant, singular]
* made as something God promises to keep

Gen 26:3-4 covenant with Abraham now called oath, reassured to Isaac
--------------------------------------------------------------------

!!!
   3 Sojourn [remain] in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the **oath**(H7621) **which I sware unto Abraham** thy father; 
   4 And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and **in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed**; 

* the covenant with Abraham is now referred to as an oath
* the blessings are now made more specific, not only for the direct descendant, but *all the nations*.
  * that means what? Gentiles also
  * thy seed is singular, as Paul clears up in Galatians 3:16, so the seed is Jesus and in Him all the nations are blessed.

Exodus 19:3 KJV
---------------

!!!
   3  And Moses went up unto God, and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to **the house of Jacob**, and tell **the children of Israel**; 

* Specifically to the children of Israel, what we now would call the Jews

Exodus 19:5-6
-------------

!!!
   [... tell the children of Israel ...] 5 Now therefore, if you will faithfully obey My voice and keep My covenant(H1285), then you shall be My special possession out of all the nations, for all the earth is Mine. 6 And you will be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.”

* Here it's called a covenant again and is with the children of Israel
* Here it's something the Israelites are supposed to keep
* They will be a kingdom of priests

Leviticus 26:46 KJV
-------------------

!!!
   46 These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the Lord made between him and the **children of Israel** in Mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.

* Specifically to the children of Israel, what we now would call the Jews

Romans 4
--------

The whole chapter is about Abraham, and that God blessed Abraham and called him righteous (Gen 15:i) not because of his works, but his belief in God. And that God did this before He made the covenant (Gen 15:18) and before Abraham was circumcised, meaning before any jew/gentile distinction. 

* Therefore saved-because-of-faith-not-works is a principle that applies to both, Jews and Gentiles.

Romans 2:14-15 KJV
------------------

!!!
   14  For when the **Gentiles**, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, **having not the law**, are a law unto themselves: 
   15  Which shew the work of **the law written in their hearts**, their conscience also bearing witness, and **their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing** one another;

* The Gentiles do not have the law written on paper
* The Gentiles do have the law written on their hearts, and they are judged by it.
* So both Jews and Gentiles have the same law and the same accountability, but it's given to them in different forms

Galatians 4:4 KJV
-----------------

!!!
   4  But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, 
   5  To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. 

* Jesus was born into a family under the law, to redeem all that were under the law
* Referring back to Romans 2:14-15 this would mean to redeem Jews and Gentiles

Jesus came for Jews only or also Gentiles?
==========================================


Mat 15:24 The Faith of the Canaanite Woman
------------------------------------------

!!!
   21 Then Jesus went from there and departed into the regions of Tyre and Sidon. 22 There, a woman of Canaan came out of the same regions and cried out to Him, saying, “Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David. My daughter is severely possessed by a demon.”

   23 But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples came and begged Him, saying, “Send her away, for she cries out after us.”

   24 But He answered, “**I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel**.”

   25 Then she came and worshipped Him, saying, “Lord, help me.”

   26 But He answered, “It is not fair to take the children’s bread and to throw it to dogs.”

   27 She said, “Yes, Lord, yet even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table.”

   28 Then Jesus answered her, “O woman, great is your faith. Let it be done for you as you desire.” **And her daughter was healed instantly**.

Matthew 15:24 KJV
-----------------

!!!
   But he answered and said, **I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel**.


* Two possible interpretations of Mat 15:24: Jesus was sent
  * a) only to the lost Jews, with the exclusion of all others
  * b) with top priority to the lost Jews, but not excluding anyone else

* If a) was true, then Jesus would not have healed the Canaanite woman's daughter, but He did. So b) is more fitting.

* If b) was true, then Jesus would have abandoned any Jew how started to believe in Him, since that is what made them not lost anymore. In particular, His apostles were clearly not part of the lost Jews, but Jesus stuck with them. So a) is not fitting, but b) is.


John 17:20-23
-------------

!!!
   20 “My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, 21 that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me. 22 I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one— 23 I in them and you in me—so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.


John 3:16 For God so loved the world ...
----------------------------------------

!!!
   16 “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.

* MAD: from context we see that *the world* must mean the *jews around the world* ???
* If the book of John is only for Jews, then this verse is not for me?
* Makes more sense to see the first four books in the NT as written with focus on the Jews, but applicable to the world.

Matthew 28:18-20 The Great Commission
-------------------------------------

!!!
   18 Then Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, “All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. 19 Go therefore and **make disciples of all nations**, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 **teaching them to observe all things I have commanded you**. And remember, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” Amen.

* MAD: from context we see that *all nations* must mean the *jews within other nations* ???
* Jesus commanded to make disciples of all nations, which is clearly more than just the Jews.
* Jesus commanded to teach to observe all the things He had commanded, which clearly defines His commands as binding for every believer, including Gentiles.
 

John 17:20-23 Jesus prays for all that will believe
---------------------------------------------------

!!!
   20 “I do not pray for these alone, but also for those who will believe in Me through their word, 21 that they may all be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You. May they also be one in Us, that the world may believe that You have sent Me. 22 I have given them the glory which You gave Me, that they may be one even as We are one: 23 I in them and You in Me, that they may be perfect in unity, and that the world may know that You have sent Me, and have loved them as You have loved Me.

* Jesus is praying for all that in the future will believe in Him, "that the world my believe".
* Hence, Jesus is stating that His ministry was for everyone, including Gentiles.

John 4:1-42 Samaritan Woman at the well
---------------------------------------

Most of that section is about Jesus talking to a non-Jewish, Samaritan woman, telling her that He is the Messiah and came to give her eternal life. Then she runs to tell her village. Then comes this next section:

!!!
   39 Many of the Samaritans of that city believed in Him because of the word of the woman who testified, “He told me all that I ever did.” 40 So when the Samaritans came to Him, they asked Him to remain with them. **And He stayed there two days. 41 And many more believed because of His word.**

* Jesus clearly preached to many Samaritans that were frowned upon by the Jews.
* => Jesus ministry was to the Gentiles, also.

Acts 8:26-40 Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch
--------------------------------------------

!!!
   26 Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Rise up and go toward the south on the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” This is desert. 27 So he rose up and went. And there was **a man of Ethiopia**, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in command of her entire treasury. He had come to Jerusalem to worship. 28 He was returning, sitting in his chariot and reading the book of Isaiah the prophet. 29 The Spirit said to Philip, “Go to this chariot and stay with it.”

   30 Then Philip ran to him, and heard him read the book of Isaiah the prophet, and said, “Do you understand what you are reading?”

   31 He said, “How can I, unless someone guides me?” So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.

   32 The passage of Scripture which he was reading was this:

   “He was led as a sheep to slaughter;
    and as a lamb before its shearer is silent,
    so He opened not His mouth.
   33 In His humiliation justice was denied Him;
    who will speak of His generation?
    For His life is taken from the earth.”[a]

   34 The eunuch said to Philip, “I ask you, of whom does the prophet speak, of himself or of someone else?” 35 Then Philip spoke, beginning with the same Scripture, and preached Jesus to him.

   36 As they went on their way, they came to some water. And the eunuch said, “Look, here is water. What hinders me from being baptized?” 37 Philip said, “If you believe with all your heart, you may.” He answered, “I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.” 38 And he commanded the chariot to halt. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and he baptized him. 39 When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took Philip away. And the eunuch saw him no more, and he went his way rejoicing. 40 But Philip was found at Azotus. And passing through, he preached the gospel in all the cities until he came to Caesarea.

* Philip was not Paul and preached to non-Jews
* He was instructed by the Holy Spirit to do so
* This was before Paul became a believer, so Philip was one of the 'original' evangelists to the Gentiles.
* => the Gospel was to be taken to Gentiles by others than Paul, too



Paul, and Apostle to the Gentiles only, or also the Jews?
=========================================================

Romans 11:13-24
---------------

!!!
   13 For I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as **I am the apostle to the Gentiles**, I **magnify my ministry, 14 if somehow I may make my kinsmen jealous and may save some of them**. 15 For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead? 16 If the first portion of the dough is holy, the batch is also holy. And if the root is holy, so are the branches.

   17 But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among them and became a partaker with them of the root and richness of the olive tree, 18 do not boast against the branches. If you boast, remember you do not sustain the root, but the root sustains you. 19 You will say then, “The branches were broken off, so that I might be grafted in.” 20 This is correct. They were broken off because of unbelief, but you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but fear. 21 For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will He spare you.

   22 Therefore consider the goodness and severity of God—severity toward those who fell, but goodness toward you, if you continue in His goodness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off. 23 And these also, if they do not remain in unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. 24 For if you were cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, who are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?

* Paul self-identifies as apostle to the Gentiles
* Paul declares his ministry as magnified, if he gets to save Jews as well
* -> Paul is an apostle to both, Gentiles and Jews, but with focus on Gentiles
  
* The olive tree is one that initially had only native branches, the Jews. But some were broken off because of unbelief.  And replaced with Gentile believers. But all current branches, Jews and Gentiles alike should not take their connection the the root, to Jesus for granted, as either will be broken off in case of unbelief, and others from either camp will be added because of belief.
* -> there is no distinction in the Gospel between Jews or Gentiles, there is only one Gospel, only one way to be saved, believe in Jesus.

No distinction between Jews and Gentiles
========================================

Romans 10:12 (NIV)
------------------

!!!
   12 For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile—the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him.

Galatians 3:28 (NIV)
--------------------

!!!
   There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.

Colossians 3:11 (NIV)
---------------------

!!!
   Here there is no Gentile or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all, and is in all.

Ephesians 2:14 (NIV)
--------------------

!!!
   For he himself [Christ] is our peace, who has made the two groups [Jews and Gentiles] one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility.

* All four sections make clear that Jews and Gentiles are saved in the same way, that what is applicable to the one group is also to the other, that from the view of Gospel, there is only one group: people.
* Everyone actually agrees on this interpretation
* The question is if this equality is only since Acts 28 or already earlier in the New Testament

The Last Supper vs Communion
============================

* Was the Last Supper the inauguration of Communion, or are the two more separate?
* Is communion required? Is it a commanded ordinance or just a tradition?

* There are multiple accounts in the Gospels, where Jesus is speaking directly to the Apostles. He tells them to *do this in remembrance of me*. From the Gospels it's not clear if this is supposed to be an instruction only to the men at the table or to more.
   
1 Corinthians 11:23-26 KJV, Last Supper restated
------------------------------------------------

* Paul repeats the gospel account of the Last Supper. It's still not clear who it is to be applied to.

1 Corinthians 11:28-29 KJV Last Supper for any man that's worthy
----------------------------------------------------------------

!!!
   28  But let **a man examine himself**, and so **let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup**. 
   29  For he that eateth and drinketh **unworthily**, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. 

* Paul clarifies that the Last Supper tradition is for any man, as long as we examine ourselves and find us to be worthy.  From the wider context, we know this worthiness means believing in Jesus' finished work on the cross and not living contrary to our believe.


Water Baptism
=============

Romans 6:1-7 The symbolic meaning of Baptism
--------------------------------------------

!!!
   1 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may increase? 2 God forbid! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it? **3 Do you not know that we who were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into His death? 4 Therefore we were buried with Him by baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.**

   5 For if we have been united with Him in the likeness of His death, so shall we also be united with Him in the likeness of His resurrection, 6 knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him, so that the body of sin might be destroyed, and we should no longer be slaves to sin. 7 For the one who has died is freed from sin.

"Baptized into Christ", just as commanded in the Great Commission in Matthew 28:18-20.
Baptism into Christ's "dead and burial by baptism" and then "just as Christ were raised to new life".
So clearly baptism is a symbol of believing in and identifying with Jesus's death, burial, resurrection and new life.
This symbolism only makes sense if the baptism Paul is talking about is full immersion water baptism of a new believer.

As after the resurrection Jesus walked in newness of life, so should we. For us, as verses 1-2 and 6-7 show, this newness of life includes the being freed from the bondage of sin. And that should be reflected in our behavior.

From the wider context, we know that baptism is not needed for salvation and that at the time of belief, we are already a new creation with newness of life.  Here, Paul is using the actual newness of life due to our salvation and the symbolic one due to water baptism as the combined reason to not let sin reign. That makes most sense, if the water baptism was part of the standard conversion experience under Paul - because then both versions exist at about the same time, and were both in effect for his audience.

Furthermore, Paul implied that all of his listeners were baptized, this also means that this water baptism was part of the normal conversion process for new believers.

Matthew 3:16 Jesus was baptized my immersion
--------------------------------------------

!!!
   16 As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him.

Jesus was baptized by immersion. If we want to imitate Him, then we should be baptized by immersion, too.

Matthew 28:19
-------------

!!!
   19 Therefore go and make disciples of **all nations, baptizing them** in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,

OSH: Baptism is a universal command from Jesus that he emphasized in His last and prime command to us.

MAD: Jesus commanded only the Jews, so this is not for us. _All nations_ refers to scattered Jews across the world.
=> OSH: That _all nations_ is supposed to exclude 99.81% of the people of all nations sounds unrealistic.
