---

## Attributes of Deity (Overview)

* Divine attributes explicitly predicated of the Spirit
  * Called God (Acts 5:3–4)
  * Eternity (Hebrews 9:14)
  * Omnipresence (Psalm 139:7–8)
  * Omniscience (1 Corinthians 2:10–11)
  * Holiness (Romans 1:4)
  * Love (Romans 5:5)

## The Spirit Is God

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit […]? […] You have not lied to men but to God.”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Acts 5:3–4 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Peter equates lying to the Spirit with lying to God
* “Lie to” is personal language: you don’t meaningfully lie to an impersonal force (e.g., gravity)
* Conclusion: the Spirit is not merely an impersonal “power”; the Spirit is divine
* **JWs:** Lying to God's spirit is lying to God, since the spirit is God's power.
  * **Illogical:** "Lie to" assumes a personal recipient; you don't lie to a force.
  * The text distinguishes "the Holy Spirit" from "God" and then equates them; it identifies the Spirit with God.

## Eternity

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the **eternal Spirit** offered Himself without spot to God […]”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Hebrews 9:14 (NKJV)</em></p>

* “Eternal” is a divine attribute
* The Spirit is not a late addition to God’s life
* **JWs:** "Eternal" means everlasting in effect, not that the Spirit is eternal.
  * **Illogical:** The word "eternal" modifies "Spirit" directly; everlasting means future without end, eternal also means without beginning, that's very different.

## Omnipresence

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence?”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Psalm 139:7 (NKJV)</em></p>

* The Spirit is not localized like a creature
* The Spirit is present with God’s people everywhere
* **JWs:** The Spirit is God's presence everywhere, but not omnipresent itself.
  * **Illogical:** The psalm equates "Your Spirit" with "Your presence"; if the Spirit is God's presence, it's attributing omnipresence to the Spirit.

## Omniscience

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God. […] Even so no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>1 Corinthians 2:10–11 (NKJV)</em></p>

* The Spirit comprehends the thoughts of God
* This is not creaturely knowledge
* **JWs:** The Spirit reveals God's knowledge, but doesn't possess it.
  * **Illogical:** The text says "the Spirit searches" and "no one knows except the Spirit"; this attributes knowledge directly to the Spirit, not just revelation.

## Holiness and Love

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“and declared to be the Son of God with power according to the **Spirit of holiness**, by the resurrection from the dead.”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.75em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Romans 1:4 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“Now hope does not disappoint, because the **love of God** has been poured out in our hearts **by the Holy Spirit** who was given to us.”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.75em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Romans 5:5 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Holiness and Love that does not disappoint are perfection
  * Thus they are divine attributes
* **JWs:** Holiness and love are God's, expressed through the Spirit.
  * **Illogical:** The Spirit is called "Spirit of holiness" and actively pours out love; impersonal forces don't possess holiness nor pour out personal attributes like love.
