# Personhood of the Holy Spirit

---

## Third Person of the Trinity

* The Holy Spirit is the **third person** of the Trinity
  * Co-equal with the Father and the Son
  * Fully divine, fully personal
  * Not an impersonal "active force" (as Jehovah's Witnesses (JW) teach)
* Not “Jesus’ ghost” (archaic “Holy Ghost” can mislead)
* Therefore: don’t speak of the Spirit as an “it”

---

## Personhood: The Spirit Speaks

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“[…] the Holy Spirit said, ‘Now separate to Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.’”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Acts 13:2 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Speech + first-person pronouns (“me”) indicate personhood
* The Spirit issues directives and calls people to mission
* “to me” indicates the Spirit’s own identity, not just God speaking through it
  * If JWs were correct, it should be to God, but isn't

## Personhood: He, the Spirit Will be In/With you

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“If you love Me, keep My commandments. And I will pray the Father, and He will give you **another Helper**, that **He** may abide with you forever, **the Spirit** of truth, **whom** the world cannot receive, because it neither sees **Him** nor knows **Him**; but you know **Him**, for **He dwells** with you and will be in you.”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -1.5em;"> <em>John 14:15–17 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Jesus promises “another Counselor/Helper”
  * The Spirit will "dwell with" and “be in" you (John 14:15–17)
  * “Another” implies another of the same kind, another person
    * If JWs were correct, it should be a different helper, but it isn't
* NT writers intentionally use the masculine pronoun **He** for the Spirit
  * Breaking standard Greek grammar (since “pneuma” is neuter)
  * JW appeals to conventions in other languages: invalid, text is Greek

## Personhood: The Spirit Teaches and Guides

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“But **the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom** the Father will send in My name, **He** will **teach** you all things […]”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>John 14:25–26 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“However, when **He, the Spirit** of truth, has come, **He** will **guide** you into all truth […]”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>John 16:13 (NKJV)</em></p>

* He, the Spirit will “teach you all things” (John 14:25–26)
  * “Whom the Father will send” implies a person, not a force
  * Teaching is interactive and requires personhood
  * **JWs:** Spirit 'teaches' via God's power, but powers do not teach, only persons
* He, the Spirit will “guide you into all truth” (John 16:13–15)
* NT writers intentionally use the masculine pronoun **He** for the Spirit
  * Breaking standard Greek grammar (since “pneuma” is neuter)

## Personhood: The Spirit Intercedes (Romans 8:26)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us […] according to the will of God.”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Romans 8:26 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Intercession implies mind, intention, and agency
* **JWs:** God facilitates our prayer via His power (spirit)
  * **Illogical:** Intercession is not toward us but for us toward God. Requires the intercessor to be a person distinct from God - can't be God to God

## Personhood: The Spirit Intercedes (Romans 8:27)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“Now He who searches the hearts knows what **the mind of the Spirit** is, because He makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God.”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Romans 8:27 (NKJV)</em></p>

* “The mind of the Spirit” (Romans 8:27) → personal subject
* **JWs:** "The mind of the Spirit": This is God's mind or will being expressed through the Spirit, not the Spirit having its own mind or thoughts.
  * **Illogical:** The text says "the mind of the Spirit", not "the mind of God" - mind can only apply to a person. Attributing a mind to an impersonal force is like saying "the thoughts of my hammer" to mean my thoughts expressed through the hammer.

## Distinctness: Not the Father or the Son

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.75em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Matthew 28:19 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.75em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>2 Corinthians 13:14 (NKJV)</em></p>

* The Spirit is not merely the Father/Son “in a different role”
* Triadic formulas name three distinct persons together
* **JWs:** Holy Spirit refers to God's active force, not a person. 
  * **Illogical:** The parallel structure ("in the name of A and of B and of C") treats all three equally as persons with names/authorities; denying personhood to the Holy Spirit violates the grammar

## Summary: Personhood of the Holy Spirit

* Third person of the Trinity: co-equal, fully divine, fully personal
* Speaks and issues directives (Acts 13:2)
* Teaches and guides believers (John 14:26; 16:13)
* Intercedes in prayer (Romans 8:26–27)
* Distinct from Father and Son (Matthew 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14)
* Masculine pronouns emphasize personhood (“who”, not “which”)
* Possesses mind, will, and agency (Romans 8:26–27)
* None of the JW arguments to the contrary are sound
