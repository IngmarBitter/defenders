# Work of the Holy Spirit

---

## Overview: Work of the Holy Spirit

* The Spirit is everywhere in Christian doctrine and life
* The Spirit's work is not a narrow "add-on" to salvation
* Old Testament: temporary empowerment for specific tasks
* New Testament: permanent indwelling through Spirit-baptism
* Eleven key ministries of the Spirit:
  * (1-3) Foundation: Creation, Revelation, and Inspiration of Scripture
  * (4-7) Salvation: conception, regeneration, indwelling, assurance
  * (8-11) Christian life: sanctification, gifts, fruit, evangelism

---

# (1) Creation

---

## Spirit Active in Creation

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Genesis 1:2 (NKJV)</em></p>

* God's "Spirit" is active from the very beginning of creation
* The Spirit "hovering" suggests active, life-giving presence
* **JWs:** "Spirit" here is God's impersonal active force, like wind or energy moving over the waters
* **Illogical:** Impersonal forces don't "hover" with purposeful presence - the Hebrew word suggests protective, deliberate action like a bird over its nest (cf. Deut 32:11)

---

## The Spirit Creates and Adorns

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"The Spirit of God has made me, And the breath of the Almighty gives me life."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.75em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Job 33:4 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"By His Spirit He adorned the heavens; His hand pierced the fleeing serpent."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.75em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Job 26:13 (NKJV)</em></p>

* The Spirit is the source of human life - "has made me"
* The Spirit adorns the heavens - beautifying and ordering creation
* **JWs:** Job 33:4 means God's life-force created humans; Job 26:13 means God's power decorated the sky
* **Illogical:** Job 33:4 attributes direct creative action to the Spirit ("has made"), not passive transmission. Job 26:13 credits the Spirit with aesthetic work - "adorning" requires design and purpose

---

# (2) Revelation

---

## The Spirit Reveals God's Truth

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"But as it is written: 'Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, Nor have entered into the heart of man The things which God has prepared for those who love Him.' But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God. […] These things we also speak, not in words which man's wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.75em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>1 Corinthians 2:9-13 (NKJV)</em></p>

* The Spirit reveals divine truths that no human could know
* The Spirit searches even "the deep things of God"
* The Spirit teaches spiritual truths in words He provides
* **JWs:** The "spirit" here is God's impersonal active force revealing information to Christians
* **Illogical:** Impersonal forces don't "search" or "teach" - these require intelligence. The Spirit "searches" the depths of God (v.10)

---

## The Spirit of Truth Guides

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>John 16:13 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Jesus promises the Spirit will guide the apostles into all truth
* The Spirit hears, speaks, and tells - all personal activities
* The Spirit has authority relationships ("not on His own authority")
* **JWs:** This is Jesus describing God's impersonal force giving information
* **Illogical:** Forces don't "guide," "hear," "speak," or "tell" - these require personhood. The phrase "Spirit of truth" indicates personal identity, not mere power

---

# (3) Inspiration of Scripture

---

## The Spirit Moved the Biblical Authors

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation, for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>2 Peter 1:20-21 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Prophetic Scripture did not come from human will
* The Holy Spirit "moved" the prophets - active divine agency
* The Spirit ensured God's prophetic message was accurately communicated
* **JWs:** The "holy spirit" was God's force that impelled men to write
* **Illogical:** Being "moved by" someone implies personal direction, not impersonal force. The text contrasts human will with the Spirit's agency - showing two personal wills, not force vs. will

---

# (4) Conception of Christ

---

## The Spirit and the Incarnation

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"And the angel answered and said to her, 'The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you; therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God.'"</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.75em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Luke 1:35 (NKJV)</em></p>

* The Holy Spirit's role in Christ's incarnation is unique and miraculous
* "Come upon" and "overshadow" suggest personal protective presence
* The Spirit enables the incarnation - God becoming flesh
* **JWs:** God's active force caused Mary's pregnancy, like electricity powering a device
* **Illogical:** "Overshadow" is a protective, personal action (like wings covering), not impersonal energy. The parallel structure ("Holy Spirit will come" / "power will overshadow") shows two agent actions

---

## Joseph's Angelic Reassurance

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: After His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit. […] But while he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, 'Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.'"</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Matthew 1:18, 20 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Matthew emphasizes "of the Holy Spirit" twice - the Spirit is the agent
* Joseph receives divine confirmation of the Spirit's role
* "That which is conceived" - the Spirit actively causes conception
* **JWs:** God's impersonal power transferred life-force to Mary's womb
* **Illogical:** "Of the Holy Spirit" indicates personal source/agency, not mere power transfer. If impersonal, why would the angel need to reassure Joseph by naming the Spirit specifically?

---

# (5) Spiritual Birth

---

## Born of the Spirit

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"Jesus answered, 'Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born again.'"</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.75em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>John 3:5-7 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Physical birth (flesh) does not grant entry to the kingdom
* Spirit birth does, and is given by the Holy Spirit
* **JWs:** "Born of spirit" means becoming a spirit creature (only for a select 144,000)
* **Illogical:** Paul says "those in the flesh" don't belong to Christ, but "if anyone" has the Spirit, they are Christ's (Rom 8:9). Flesh/Spirit contrasts unbelievers vs. believers - not two classes of believers

---

## The 144,000: Setting the Scene

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"After these things I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, on the sea, or on any tree. Then I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God. And he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea, saying, 'Do not harm the earth, the sea, or the trees till we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.'"</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Revelation 7:1–3 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Angels at "four corners of the **earth**" — scene is on earth
* Sealing happens "on their **foreheads**" — servants are on earth
* Context: earthly protection before judgment

---

## The 144,000 in Context

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"And I heard the number of those who were sealed. One hundred and forty-four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel were sealed: of the tribe of {Judah|Reuben|Gad|Asher|Naphtali|Manasseh|Simeon|Levi|Issachar|Zebulun|Joseph|Benjamin} twelve thousand were sealed.<br>After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no one could number, of all nations, tribes, peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, with palm branches in their hands,"</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Revelation 7:4–9 (NKJV)</em></p>

* 144,000 from **twelve tribes of Israel** — sealed on earth (v.1–3)
* Great multitude — standing **before the throne** in heaven
* Apocalyptic literature full of symbolic numbers: 7 seals 4 horsemen …

---

## 144,000 Interpretation

* **JWs:** 144,000 is literal and only those will go to heaven
  * The multitude will stay on earth
  * The 12 tribes are symbolic and stand in place for JW believers.
* **Illogical:** If the number is literal, why aren't the tribes literal?
  * JWs can't trace lineage to these tribes
  * The great multitude is seen in heaven - why expect not to go there?
  * JWs = true believers => apostles = JW => Each discipled at least one true believer every 3 years, who then did the same
  * => 42 years = 14x doubling = 12 x 16,000 > 144,000 believers
  * After the 1st century there were no slots left for any JW!
  * 144,000 = 12x12x1000 = complete = symbolic = all God's people

---

## "Before the Throne" — Even in the NWT

* JWs say "before the throne" is figurative — great crowd on earth, not heaven
* But NWT Rev 7:15 says they serve God "**in his temple**" — JWs teach the temple is in heaven!
* Same Greek word "enopion" (before) used for:
  * 24 elders — in heaven
  * 144,000 — in heaven
  * Angels — in heaven
  * Great crowd — on earth??
* **Special pleading:** same word, different meaning to fit doctrine
* JWs taught great crowd was in heaven until 1935 — then changed

---

# (6) Indwelling and Spirit-Baptism

---

## The Spirit Dwells in Believers

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.75em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Romans 8:9 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Paul contrasts "in the flesh" (unbelievers) vs. "in the Spirit" (believers)
* "If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His"
* Clear universal statement: all who belong to Christ have the Spirit dwelling in them
* **JWs:** The Spirit dwells only in the 144,000 anointed class, not the "great crowd"
* **Illogical:** Paul says "if anyone" - no two-class system here. Either you have the Spirit and belong to Christ, or you don't have the Spirit and aren't His

---

## One Body, One Spirit

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free—and have all been made to drink into one Spirit."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.75em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>1 Corinthians 12:13 (NKJV)</em></p>

* "All" baptized by one Spirit into one body - no distinction between believers
* Eliminates ethnic (Jew/Greek) and social (slave/free) barriers
* **JWs:** Only the 144,000 are baptized by the Spirit into Christ's body; the great crowd is not
* **Illogical:** Paul's "all" includes every category of believer. If it removes Jew/Greek barriers, it removes any hypothetical heaven/earth class barriers too

---

## Your Body: The Spirit's Temple

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.75em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>1 Corinthians 6:19-20 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Paul addresses all Corinthian believers - their bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit
* They "have" the Spirit "from God" - present possession
* Motivation for holy living: the Spirit dwells within
* **JWs:** Only the 144,000's bodies are temples of the holy spirit
* **Illogical:** Paul writes to the whole Corinthian church (including immoral members he's correcting). If only an elite had the Spirit, his argument makes no sense

---

# (7) Assurance of Salvation

---

## The Spirit Bears Witness

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, 'Abba, Father.' The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,"</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.75em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Romans 8:14-16 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Those led by the Spirit are sons of God - sonship language
* The Spirit of adoption enables believers to call God "Father"
* The Spirit personally testifies to our spirits that we are God's children
* **JWs:** Only the 144,000 are adopted as sons; they alone have the Spirit's witness. The "great crowd" are not sons but friends
* **Illogical:** Paul writes to all Roman believers (not select elite), saying "as many as are led by the Spirit" are sons. The universal language contradicts the two-class system

---

# (8) Sanctification

---

## Walk in the Spirit

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.75em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Galatians 5:16-18 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Walking in the Spirit is the means of victory over fleshly desires
* The Spirit and flesh are in active conflict within the believer
* Being led by the Spirit means freedom from the law's condemnation
* **JWs:** Only the 144,000 are led by the Spirit; the great crowd must follow Bible principles through human effort
* **Illogical:** Paul addresses all Galatian believers, commanding them to "walk in the Spirit." If most believers don't have the Spirit, Paul's command is impossible and cruel

---

# (9) Spiritual Gifts

---

## OT Pattern: Temporary Empowerment

* In the Old Covenant, God's Spirit "comes upon" individuals
  * For a **specific task**
  * For a **limited time**
* Examples: Bezalel for craftsmanship (Exodus 31:1-3)
* Seventy elders for governance (Numbers 11:16-17, 25)
* Judges for deliverance: Othniel, Gideon, Jephthah, Samson

---

## Example: Spirit Empowers Craftsmanship

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: 'See, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,'"</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Exodus 31:1-3 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Spirit empowerment isn't only "religious ecstasy"
* Includes practical gifting for God's purposes
* Temporary - for building the tabernacle

---

## Example: Spirit Empowers Leadership

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"So the Lord said to Moses: 'Gather to Me seventy men of the elders of Israel […] Then I will come down and talk with you there. I will take of the Spirit that is upon you and will put the same upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you may not bear it yourself alone.'"</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Numbers 11:16-17 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"Then the Lord came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and placed the same upon the seventy elders; and it happened, when the Spirit rested upon them, that they prophesied, although they never did so again."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Numbers 11:25 (NKJV)</em></p>

* They prophesied once - "although they never did so again"
* Temporary empowerment for governance

---

## Example: Judges Empowered for Deliverance

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"When the children of Israel cried out to the Lord, the Lord raised up a deliverer for the children of Israel, who delivered them: Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother. The Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he judged Israel."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Judges 3:9-10 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Gideon (Judges 6:34), Jephthah (Judges 11:29), Samson (Judges 13-15)
* "The Spirit of the Lord came upon" - temporary for specific crises
* Pattern: Spirit comes, task done, Spirit departs

---

## NT Pattern: Permanent Spiritual Gifts

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. There are differences of ministries, but the same Lord. And there are diversities of activities, but it is the same God who works all in all. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all: for to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, to another the word of knowledge through the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another different kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually as He wills."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.75em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>1 Corinthians 12:4-11 (NKJV)</em></p>

* The Spirit sovereignly distributes diverse gifts "as He wills"
* Each believer receives a manifestation of the Spirit for the common good
* Nine specific gifts listed - all from the same Spirit
* **JWs:** Spiritual gifts ceased after the apostolic era; modern JWs don't have these gifts
* **Illogical:** Paul emphasizes the Spirit "distributes...as He wills" - showing personal volition, not impersonal force. Claiming these gifts ceased contradicts the Spirit's ongoing role in the church

---

## NT Adds Permanent Indwelling

* In addition to spiritual gifts, NT believers have:
  * Permanent indwelling for comfort and support (sections 4-7)
  * Sanctification and character transformation (section 8)
* OT: Spirit came temporarily for tasks
* NT: Spirit dwells permanently + gives gifts for service

---

# (10) Spiritual Fruits

---

## The Fruits of the Spirit

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law. And those who are Christ's have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.75em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Galatians 5:22-24 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Nine character qualities produced by the Spirit in believers
* This is singular "fruit" (not "fruits") - unified character transformation
* "Against such there is no law" - these qualities transcend legalism
* Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh and live by the Spirit
* **JWs:** The "great crowd" can develop these qualities through self-discipline and following Bible principles, without the Spirit's indwelling
* **Illogical:** Paul calls it "fruit of the Spirit" - the Spirit is the source. Self-effort cannot produce Spirit-fruit. Either the Spirit produces this fruit in you, or it's mere human morality

---

# (11) Evangelism and Witness

---

## Power for Witness

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.75em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Acts 1:8 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Jesus promises the Spirit will empower witness - power for evangelism
* Geographic expansion: Jerusalem → Judea → Samaria → ends of the earth
* The book of Acts shows this pattern unfolding (Acts 2, 8, 10-11, 19)
* The Spirit creates one unified church body across all ethnic boundaries
* **JWs:** The Spirit empowered the early church, but modern witnessing is done through organizational training and door-to-door methods
* **Illogical:** Jesus promises "you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you." If the Spirit doesn't empower modern witness, then Jesus' promise failed. Either the Spirit still empowers evangelism, or the Great Commission is impossible

---

## Summary: The Vital Work of the Holy Spirit

* The Holy Spirit is far from the "forgotten person" of the Trinity
* His work spans from creation to consummation:
  * **Foundation:** Creation, Revelation, Inspiration of Scripture
  * **Salvation:** Conception of Christ, Regeneration, Indwelling, Assurance
  * **Christian Life:** Sanctification, Spiritual Gifts, Spiritual Fruits, Evangelism
* **OT:** Temporary empowerment for specific tasks (Bezalel, Judges)
* **NT:** Permanent indwelling via Spirit-baptism (Acts 1:8 expansion)
* The Spirit's personal agency refutes JW's "impersonal force" theology
* Every believer possesses and needs the Spirit's power for the Christian life
