# Relation of the Holy Spirit to Christ

---

## Conception of Christ

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you; therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God.”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Luke 1:35 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Virginal conception is attributed to the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:35)
* From the beginning of the incarnation, the Spirit is active
* **JWs:** The Holy Spirit is God's power that overshadows Mary.
  * **Illogical:** The verse names both "the Holy Spirit" and "the power of the Highest"; “power” describes divine action/effect, not a definition that reduces the Spirit to an impersonal force.

## Baptism and Anointing

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“When all the people were baptized, it came to pass that Jesus also was baptized; and while He prayed, the heaven was opened. And the Holy Spirit descended in bodily form like a dove upon Him, and a voice came from heaven which said, ‘You are My beloved Son; in You I am well pleased.’”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Luke 3:21–22 (NKJV)</em></p>

* At Jesus’ baptism, Father/Son/Spirit are all present (Luke 3:21–22)
  * Spirit descends upon the Son
  * Public inauguration and empowering for ministry
* **JWs:** The Spirit is God's active force that descends visibly as a dove
  * **Illogical:** The Spirit "descended … like a dove"—a visible manifestation in a Father/Son/Spirit scene; that’s not how Scripture describes an impersonal force.

## Miracles and Exorcisms

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him.”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Acts 10:38 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, surely the kingdom of God has come upon you.”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Matthew 12:28 (NKJV)</em></p>

* God anointed Jesus with the Holy Spirit and power (Acts 10:38)
* Jesus attributes exorcisms to the Spirit of God (Matthew 12:28)
* **JWs:** Jesus' miracles are by God's spirit (power), not a separate person.
  * **Illogical:** The text says "anointed with the Holy Spirit and power," treating Spirit and power as distinct; if Spirit is just power, it's redundant.

## Preaching and Mission (Luke 4:14)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“Then Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and news of Him went out through all the surrounding region.”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.75em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Luke 4:14 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Jesus ministers “in the power of the Spirit” (Luke 4:14)
* This shows the Spirit's ongoing empowerment of Christ's mission
* **JWs:** Jesus is empowered by God's spirit (force), not a person.
  * **Illogical:** Scripture can speak of the "power of the Spirit"—distinguishing the Spirit from the power by which Jesus ministers.

## Preaching and Mission (Luke 4:18–21)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“The Spirit of the Lord is on Me, Because He has anointed Me To preach the gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, To proclaim liberty to the captives And recovery of sight to the blind, To set at liberty those who are oppressed; To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Luke 4:18–21 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Isaiah’s prophecy applied to Jesus’ preaching: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me…” (Luke 4:18–21)
* Implication: if Jesus’ earthly ministry is Spirit-empowered, ours must be also
* **JWs:** Jesus is empowered by God's spirit (force), not a person.
  * **Illogical:** The text distinguishes "the Spirit of the Lord" from Jesus ("on Me") and presents the Spirit as the source of anointing/commissioning, not merely an impersonal force.

## Continuing Christ’s Ministry (John 16:7)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“Nevertheless I tell you the truth. It is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send Him to you.”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>John 16:7 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Jesus: it is “to your advantage” that he goes away so the Spirit comes (John 16:7)
* Jesus promises to send the Spirit as His personal representative
* The Spirit's coming is contingent on Jesus' departure, showing distinct roles
* **JWs:** The Spirit is God's force sent after Jesus.
  * **Illogical:** Jesus speaks of "the Helper" whom He will send, and whose coming is contingent on Jesus’ departure—distinct roles, not merely “God’s force.”

## Continuing Christ’s Ministry (John 16:13–15)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">“However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come. He will glorify Me, for He will take of what is Mine and declare it to you.”</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>John 16:13–15 (NKJV)</em></p>

* The Spirit continues and extends Christ’s ministry in the church age
  * Convicts the world
  * Guides into truth
  * Glorifies Christ (John 16:13–15)
* **JWs:** The Spirit is God's force that continues Jesus' work impersonally.
  * **Illogical:** The Spirit "hears," "speaks," and "glorifies," those are personal actions; forces don't hear or speak on their own.

## Summary: Relation of the Holy Spirit to Christ

* The Spirit is involved in Christ's conception, baptism, miracles, preaching, and ongoing ministry
* Jesus' ministry is Spirit-empowered, and the Spirit continues it after His ascension
* None of the JW arguments to the contrary are sound
