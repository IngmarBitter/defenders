Video Introduction

## Values & Duties

![](Values.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Values
  * Something being Good or Bad 
  * Something having worth
    * Human dignity, Help a stranger in need
* Duties
  * Something we ought to do or not do
    * Donate vs Steal, Tell truth vs Lying
* It's good to become a doctor or scientist (value)
  * but there is no obligation to become either (duty)

---

## Objective and Subjective

![](Subjective.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Subjective
  * Each man's/subject's opinion
  * Something we decide individually
    * Chocolate icecream is best
* Objective
  * Inherent in the object
  * Independent of man's opinion
    * The Holocaust was objectively wrong
      * Even if some disagree

## Moral Argument

![](MoralArgument.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

1. If God does not exist,<br> 
  => there is no moral standard binding for all humans<br>
  => objective moral values and duties do not exist. 
2. Objective moral values and duties do exist. 
3. => Therefore, God exists.

Premise 1. is logical equivalent to:<br>
1b. If objective moral values duties do exist,<br>
  => there is a moral standard binding for all humans<br>
  => God does exist and His inherent goodness is that standard.<br>
Hence, 3. does follow logically from 1. and 2.

## Moral Argument

![](MoralArgument.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

1. If God does not exist,<br> 
  => there is no moral standard binding for all humans<br>
  => objective moral values and duties do not exist. 
  * *typical atheist view: <br>  morals evolved differently in different societies (=> are subjective)*
2. Objective moral values and duties do exist. 
  * *typical conviction: <br>  murder and child abuse are really, always wrong (=> are objective)*
3. => Therefore, God exists.

---

## Premise 1

1. If God does not exist, objective moral values and duties do not exist. 

![](UpOrDown.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Science does *not* produce *any* moral values/duties
* Evolution does *not* produce *objective* values/duties
  * Killing innocents, rape and incest are normal in the animal kingdom
* Morals evolved differently in different societies (=> subjective)

* Only if God does exist and gives us worth and moral laws 
  * then have moral values and duties,
  * that "are grounded" in God as the reference standard

---

## Premise 1

1. If God does not exist, objective moral values and duties do not exist. 

![](SaveCat.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* NOT saying: Atheists are bad people
  * Belief in God is not needed to be nice/caring
* NOT saying: Atheists cannot recognize objective moral values
  * Belief in God is not needed know we ought to love our children
* NOT saying: Atheists cannot make an effective set of ethics laws
  * Belief in God is not needed for human rights and good laws
* AM saying: Labeling something as objectively good 
  * does require grounding in God 
    * => therefore requires belief in God's existence

## Euthyphro Dilemma

![](Euthyphro.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

1. Is something good because God wills it? 
  * Then the good is arbitrary
    * God could decide to command us to torture children
2. Does God will something because it is good? 
  * Then it is a moral value independent of God
    * That's co-eternal with God
    * That is superior to God and is controlling God
3. Not a dilemma, there is option 3:
  * God wills something because He is good
    * God's nature is to be good
    * God only acts and wills according to his nature

---

## God as grounding for the good

![](GodIsGood.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* The Euthyphro options 1. and 2. would prevent God from being a valid grounding for good moral values
* Since option 3. is possible, God can be the grounding
* Since we need some grounding, option 3. must be the correct one.
* Also, the options 1. and 2. have strong defeaters

## Atheistic Objective Morals

![](MoralArgument.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

1. Atheistic Moral Platonism
  * Moral values are real and exist eternally
    * Contrary to common sense
    * No means by which it becomes our objective duties to act according to good values

---

## Atheistic Objective Morals

![](MoralArgument.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

2. Improving Human Flourishing is objectively good
  * Is arbitrary
    * Why prefer humans over other animals?
    * Who gets to define flourishing? 
      * Hitler?  The Pope?
  * Is implausible
    * Goodness and Badness cannot attach themselves to people or actions
  * Humanism has great moral values and duties
    * Does not have any grounding for them

---

## Premise 2

2. Objective moral values and duties exist.

![](ObjectiveMorals.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Objectively wrong:
  * murder, rape, child abuse, torture, genocide
* Moral experience is a sixth sence
  * Feeling of right and wrong
    * Default: is corresponding to reality
    * Unless there is some rational counter reason
    * Same for sight, touch, smell, ...
  
* Counter reason
  * ...

---

## Premise 2

2. Objective moral values and duties exist.

![](MoralArgument.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Counter reason
  * Moral values evolved gradually => subjecive
    * !! Same evidence supports gradual discovery => objective

---

## Premise 2

2. Objective moral values and duties exist.

![](MoralArgument.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Counter reason
  * moral sense evolved for survival 
    * => sense does not provide truth
      * => cannot trust
    * !! assumes atheism, basically premise 1
      * => but we cannot assume atheism in a premise
    * !! is selfdefeating => not only moral sense but also rational thought would be only for survival not truth
      * => belief in atheism cannot be trusted

---

## Moral Argument

![](MoralArgument.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

1. If God does not exist, 
  * objective moral values and duties do not exist. 
2. Objective moral values and duties do exist. 
3. Therefore, God exists.

Is a sound argument.

---

## Conclusions

![](GodsNature.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* God is the grounding for moral values and duties
* God is good by nature
* God wants us to align our thoughts and actions with His goodness

* Thank You!

* Questions?
