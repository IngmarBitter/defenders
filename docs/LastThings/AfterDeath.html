# Our Existence After Death 

## Body Soul Dualism

### Definitions

To clarify terms, in the following I use these definitions:
* **Body**: Our physical flesh and blood body
* **Soul**: Our immaterial identity as person
  * **Mind**: the part of our soul that uses our brain to think rationally and to move muscles
  * **Heart**: the part of our soul where our emotions reside
  * **Spirit**: the part of our soul that communicates with God

### Near Death Experiences

Near-death experiences (NDEs) are subjective experiences that can occur during or after a life-threatening event. They can vary widely from person to person, but some common features include a feeling of peace or detachment from the body, the sensation of moving through a tunnel or towards a bright light, encounters with deceased loved ones or spiritual beings, and a review of one's life.

There are some NDEs where people sensed the external world that was verified after and would not be possible if our mind and brain would be identical:

* Pam Reynolds - In 1991, Pam Reynolds underwent a brain surgery to remove an aneurysm, which required her to be clinically dead for a short period of time. During the surgery, Reynolds reported leaving her body and witnessing the surgery from above. She described details of the surgical instruments and conversation between the doctors that were later confirmed to be accurate.
* Maria - In the late 1970s, a woman known only as "Maria" underwent emergency surgery for a heart attack. During the surgery, she reported having an NDE in which she left her body and floated above the operating table. She claimed that she saw a shoe on a windowsill outside the operating room, which she later described in detail to her doctors. They initially dismissed her account, but when they went to investigate, they found the shoe exactly where she had described it.

### Neuroscience

From [Steward Goetz, PhD, Prof of Philosophy](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/question-answer/god-and-mind-body-dualism):
* Some famous neuroscientists believe the mind is immaterial, others think being able to stimulate the brain to change emotions means there is nothing beyond our physical brain.
* Correlation between brain states and emotions does not mean they are identical, just as the correlation between eating rotten food and stomach ache does not make them identical.
* People moving a muscle because of brain stimulation deny having had any thought or decision to move that muscle, just as a knew jerk reflex. The act of deciding to do/say/think something has never been triggered externally. The best explanation is that it's triggered by our mind that uses the brain.

And from [William Lane Craig](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/question-answer/why-do-determinists-say-the-self-is-an-illusion):
If the brain and mind were identical, then the best explanation of emotions is that they are a supervenient state that automacically appears whenever the brain is in a matching configuration. The problem with this view is that, as a purely materialistic view, it is free of consciousness and intentionality. Those are also just supervenient illusionary states. Or next action is not what we decide to do, but what the physical precursor state of our brain dictates we must do. We are just a biological computer running the program of nature. We are either fully deterministic or there is some quantum randomness mixed in. But either way, we are not capable of rational thought, let alone scientific inquiry and knowlege building. Such a view is therefore self-defeating.

### Piano and Pianist 

William Lane Craig has a great analogy likening the brain and mind to a piano and pianist:

Neither the piano nor the pianist can make music on their own. The pianist needs to use the piano as his instrument to make music. When the piano is tuned and in good working condition, then this can result in beautiful music. But when the piano is damaged and out of tune, then what the pianist can accomplish is quite limited.

Analogous, our mind uses our brain as an instrument to think. When the brain is in good working condition then this can result in profound thoughts and actions. But when the brain is damaged, then what our mind can accomplish is quite limited.

### Body Soul Dualism
This section gave some justification for the belief that humans have both, a material body and an immaterial soul.
The Bible is best understood with this view of human nature in mind - pun intended.
For some of the verses below it's pointed out explicitly that this dualism is implicitly taught in the verse.

---

## Old Testament: Sheol + Resurrection

### Job 7:9-10 Soul in Sheol
!!!
    <div style="white-space: pre;">   As the cloud disappears and vanishes away,
        so **he who goes down to Sheol will come up no more**.
    He will **never return to his house**,
        and his place will not recognize him anymore.</div>

* Sheol is a final resting place 
* No mention of any hope for resurrection nor of any alternate resting place.

### Psalm 6:4-5 Soul not in Sheol
!!!
    <div style="white-space: pre;">   4 Return, Oh Lord, rescue my soul.
        Save me for the sake of Your lovingkindness.
    5 For in death there is no remembrance of You;
        in Sheol who will give You thanks?</div>

* A plea to God to save the soul from going to Sheol, where there is no connection to God
* Implies that there is another place with a connection to God

### Isaiah 38:9-10,18 Hezekiah and Sheol, a place of no hope
!!!
    <div style="white-space: pre;">   9 This is the writing of Hezekiah king of Judah after his illness and recovery:
    10 I said: In the middle of my days,
        I shall go to the gates of **Sheol**;
        I am to be deprived of the rest of my years.
    I said, I shall **not see the Lord**,
        even the Lord, in the land of the living;
    I shall **see man no more**
        with the inhabitants of the world.
    . . .
    18 For Sheol cannot thank You,
        death cannot praise You;
    those who go down into the pit
        cannot hope for Your faithfulness.</div>

* Sheol is a gloomy pit "below" where there is no contact with God nor with other people that are still alive.
* In Sheol, there is no thanking nor praising God.
* *I shall go* implies going to Sheol preserves identity and the ability to sense the immediate surroundings.
* This is where Hezekiah, a faithful believer in God, thinks he will go. That is a record of a personal view and does not have to be correct, but likely was the common belief at the time. Or could be that it was really correct at the time and God changed since then where believers will go.


### Isaiah 14:9-11 Soul in Sheol, weak and tourmented
!!!
    <div style="white-space: pre;">   9 **Sheol from beneath** is moved for you
        to meet you at your coming;
    it stirs up **the wraiths<sup>h7496</sup>** for you,
        even all the chief ones of the earth;
    it has raised up from their thrones
        all the kings of the nations.
    10 They all shall speak
        and say to you:
    “Have you also become as weak as we have?
        Have you become like us?”
    11 Your pomp is brought down to Sheol,
        and the noise of your harps;
    **maggots are spread under you,
        and the worms cover you.**</div>

* Sheol is a place for wraiths, the spirits of the dead, a pale vestige of the robust human being that once lived. Wraiths is Strong's # h7496, translated quite differently in various translations.
* Instead of resting on a king mattress with soft sheets, there will be maggots and worms. A description that mixes immaterial spiritual existence with ugly, physical, material existence.

### Psalm 73:23-28 God receives our Soul to glory
!!!
    <div style="white-space: pre;">   23 Nevertheless, I am continually with You;
        You have held me by my right hand.
    24 You will guide me with Your counsel,
        and **afterward receive me to glory**.
    25 Who have I in heaven but You?
        And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides You.
    26 My flesh and my heart fail,
        but **God is the strength of my heart
        and my portion forever**.
    27 For **those who are far from You will perish**;
        You destroy everyone who is unfaithful to You.
    28 But **it is good for me to draw near to God**;
        I have taken my **refuge in the Lord God**,
        that I may declare all Your works.</div>

* God will guide before death and after death receive to glory. God provides support forever.
* There is destruction for those far from God, and refuge for those near.
* Sheol is not the only option after death 

### Isaiah 26:19 God will raise the dead
!!!
    <div style="white-space: pre;">   19 Your **dead<sup>h4191</sup> shall live**,
        their **corpses shall arise**.
    Awake and sing for joy,
        you who dwell in the dust,
    for your dew is as the dew of the dawn,
        and **the earth shall give birth to the wraiths<sup>h7496</sup>**.</div>

* God will raise the dead, the wraiths. Not the same word. Not clear if it's the wraiths from Sheol or from Psalms 73.
* Much more positive and hopeful than previous Isaiah and Job passages.

### Daniel 12:2 Resurrection to life or contempt
!!!
    2 Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, but others to shame and everlasting contempt.

* Resurrection of the dead to two opposing eternal states: life or contempt.
* Much more positive and hopeful than previous Isaiah and Job passages.

## Intertestamental Time

During the intertestamental period, the belief in the resurrection of the dead flourished in Judaism and became a very widespread belief. In Jesus’ day, it was held to by the party of the Pharisees, but it was denied by the sect known as the Sadducees. The Sadducees in Jesus’ day represented the sort of old conservative Jews. They didn’t accept the doctrine of the bodily resurrection of the dead. Nor did they believe there were any rewards and punishments in the afterlife. They held to the older, more primitive, view that Sheol is the only place. So the Sadducees rejected the notion of immortality and resurrection of the dead in the sense that we’ve been describing it. By contrast, the sect of the Pharisees affirmed both the immortality of the soul beyond the death of the body as well as the eventual resurrection of the body and retribution in future life. There would be rewards and punishments.

## New Testament

### Acts 23:6-10 Paul: we will be resurrected
!!!
    6 Then Paul, knowing that one sect was Sadducees and the other Pharisees, cried out among the Sanhedrin, “Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of a Pharisee. I am being judged for my hope in the resurrection of the dead.”  7 When he had said this, dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.  8 For the **Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit**. But the **Pharisees acknowledge them all**.<br>
    9 There was a great outcry. The scribes that were from the sect of Pharisees stood up and argued, “We find no evil in this man. But if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God.”  10 When much dissension arose, fearing that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, the commander ordered the soldiers to go down and take him from them by force and bring him into the barracks.

* Jewish belief was divided over the hope for the resurrection of the dead.
* Paul sided with the Pharisees, that such hope is warranted.

### Matthew 22:23-33 Jesus: we will be resurrected 
!!!
    23 The same day the **Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection**, came to Him and asked Him,  24 “Teacher, Moses said, ‘If a man dies having no children, his brother must marry his wife and raise up children for his brother.’  25 Now there were seven brothers with us. The first died after he married and, having no children, left his wife to his brother.  26 Likewise the second and third, on to the seventh.  27 Last of all, the woman died also.  28 Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife shall she be of the seven? For they all had her.”<br> 
    29 Jesus answered, “You err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God.  30 For **in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like the angels of God in heaven**.  31 But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God,  32 ‘**I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living**.”<br>
    33 When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at His teaching.

* Jesus talking about *in the resurrection* makes clear the Sadducees are wrong, the Pharisees correct, that there will be a resurrection of the dead.
* There will be no marriages in heaven. Our relationships will be like those of the angels.
  * That could mean 
    * (1) in our glorified bodies we will have no desire for intimacy, or 
    * (2) we will have desires, but not act upon them and worship God instead, or 
    * (3) that we will be so bathed in love and affection for everyone that we can be intimate without jealousy, just one big happy family 
    * there are no verses that make clear which of these options is correct.
* Jesus refers to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob as living. That implies that they are still alive in some sense. The continuation of the existence of the soul is the most likely explanation.

### 1 Corinthians 15:20-22 Jesus rose from the dead, so will we
!!!
    20 But now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.  21 For since death came by man, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.  22 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.

* Jesus rose from the dead. We (those *in Christ*) will rise from the dead.
* Jesus is the one through whom we will rise.
* Jesus rising from the dead is demonstrating that physical death can be overcome and that it is reasonable/rational to have hope for the same for ourselves.

### Philippians 1:21-24 to die is to be with Christ
!!!
    21 For to me, to continue living is Christ, and **to die is gain**.  22 But if I am to live on in the flesh, this will mean fruitful labor to me. Yet I do not know what I shall choose.  23 I am in a difficult position between the two, **having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, which is far better**.  24 Nevertheless, to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sake.

* Paul believed his identity, his soul, will continue to exist after death and 
* that he will be with Christ.
* He is looking forward to this life after death more so than his current physical life
* He's not contemplating suicide, as he believes he's called to help others get to know and love Jesus.

### 2 Corinthians 5:1-10 earthly and heavenly bodies
!!!
    1 We know that if our earthly house, this tent, were to be destroyed, **we have an eternal building of God in the heavens**, a house not made with hands. 2 In this one we groan, earnestly desiring to be sheltered with our house which is from heaven. 

* Paul contrasts an earthly home with our future heavenly home that is burden-free and eternal.
  * Paul used the home as a metaphor for our body, with our physical body headed for destruction, to be replaced by a better, burden-free eternal body.
    
!!!    
    3 Thus being sheltered, **we shall not be found naked**. 4 For we who are in this tent groan, being burdened, **not because we wish to be unclothed, but to be further clothed**, so that what is mortal might be swallowed up by life. 5 Now He who has created us for this very thing is God, who also has given to us the guarantee of the Spirit.

* Greek thought of the soul without a physical body as naked.
* We will not be found as naked soul because we will be *further clothed* with our glorified bodies.
  * The timing of this is unclear here. Non naked ever? or not naked for most of eternity?

!!!
    6 Therefore we are always confident, knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord. 7 For we walk by faith, not by sight. 8 Instead, I say that we are confident and willing **to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord**. 9 So whether present or absent, we labor that we may be accepted by Him. 10 For **we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ**, that each one may receive his recompense in the body, according to what he has done, whether it was good or bad.

* Being in our earthly body means being away from Jesus
  * Dying and being without our earthly body means being with Jesus. That's the better state.
* Everyone will be judged and receive morally appropriate recompense.

### Luke 16:19-31 The rich man and the beggar Lazarus
!!!
    19 “There was a **rich man** who was clothed in purple and fine linen and lived in great luxury every day. 20 There was also a **beggar named Lazarus**, covered with sores, who had been placed at his gate, 21 desiring to be fed the crumbs falling from the rich man’s table. Moreover, the dogs came and licked his sores.

    22 “It came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the angels to **Abraham’s presence**. The rich man also died and was buried. 23 In **Hades, being in torment**, he lifted up his eyes and **saw Abraham from a distance and Lazarus in his presence**. 24 So he cried out, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue. For I am tormented in this flame.’

    25 “But Abraham said, ‘Son, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things. But now **he is comforted and you are tormented**. 26 And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf, so that **those who would pass from here to you cannot, nor can those from there pass to us**.’

* After death, there are two places to go: The comforting place where Abraham is and Hades, a place of torment
* Hades is the Greek word for the Hebrew word Sheol.
* We can sense and communicate with each other in those places.
* There is no crossing over between the two places.
* There is no going back nor communicating back to the living.
!!!
    27 “He said, ‘Then I pray you, father, to send him to my father’s house, 28 for I have five brothers, to testify to them, lest they also come to this place of torment.’

    29 “Abraham said to him, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets. Let them hear them.’

* What's written in the Bible is sufficient to teach us what we need to avoid Hades.
!!!
    30 “He said, ‘No, father Abraham. But if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.’

    31 “He said to him, ‘If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone should rise from the dead.’ ”

* The Bible is at least as good at convicting as witnessing a resurrection would be

### Luke 23:42-43 The thief on the cross going to Paradise
!!!
    40 But the other rebuked him, saying, “Do you not fear God, seeing you are under the same sentence? <br>
    41 And we indeed, justly. For we are receiving the due reward of our deeds. But this Man has done nothing amiss.”<br>
    42 Then he said to Jesus, “Lord, remember me when **You come into Your kingdom**.”<br>
    43 Jesus said to him, “Truly, I tell you, **today you will be with Me in Paradise**.”

* Jesus does not correct the thief, so at His death, He will be in His kingdom.
* The thief - based on his confession of belief in Jesus's innocence and Lordship as well as his own guiltiness and turning to Jesus for compassion - will be in paradise.
* Paradise is the name Jesus gives to the place where Abraham is.

### John 5:24-30 we will be raised to face sentencing to life or judgment
!!!
    24 “Truly, truly I say to you, **whoever hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has eternal life** and shall not come into condemnation, but has **passed from death into life**. 

* Believers have eternal life, but their bodies are still buried. Hence, their identity must continue in their souls.
* *Death to life* here does not mean from physical death to life, but from condemnation to justification.

!!!
    25 Truly, truly I say to you, the hour is coming, and is now here, when **the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live**. 

* This is another expression of the same metaphor of *from physical death to life*, stands for *from condemnation to justification*.

!!!    
    26 For as the Father has life in Himself, so He has given to the Son to have life in Himself, 27 and has given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of Man.<br>
    28 “Do not marvel at this. For the hour is coming in which **all who are in the graves will hear His voice** 29 **and come out****—those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment**. 30 I can do nothing of Myself. As I hear, I judge. My judgment is just, because I seek not My own will, but the will of the Father who sent Me.

* Jesus has the authority to judge our lives. 
* This judgment is waiting for those who already died and they will be raised to face their sentencing to life or judgment.

### 1 Corinthians 4:5 judgement will be after Jesus returns
!!!
     5 Therefore **judge nothing before the appointed time until the Lord comes**. He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will reveal the purposes of the hearts. Then everyone will have commendation from God.

* Christ does not judge us right when we die, but at His second coming.

### 1 Corinthians 3:12-15 eternal rewards for kingdom work
!!!
    10 According to the grace of God which has been given to me, as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation, but another builds on it. Now let each one take heed how he builds on it. 11 For **no one can lay another foundation than that which was laid, which is Jesus Christ**. 12 Now if anyone builds on this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or stubble, 13 each one’s work will be revealed. For the Day will declare it, because it will be revealed by fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each has done. 14 **If anyone’s work which he has built on the foundation endures, he will receive a reward**. 15 **If anyone’s work is burned, he will suffer loss. But he himself will be saved, still going through the fire**.

* Jesus is the foundation that ensures we get to heaven.
* What we build on that foundation can yield additional heavenly rewards, for enduring works precious to God's kingdom, or yield nothing, for works that are not enduring. 
  * Likely that means works that contribute to growing God's kingdom on earth are rewarded and everything else is irrelevant.

### Matthew 25:31-46 Jesus separating sheep and goats
!!!
    31 **“When the Son of Man comes in His glory**, and all the holy angels with Him, then **He will sit on the throne of His glory**. 32 **Before Him will be gathered all nations, and He will separate them** one from another as a shepherd separates his sheep from the goats. 33 He will set the sheep at His right hand, but the goats at the left.

* At Jesus second coming is when He will judge us.

!!!
    34 “Then the King will say to those at His right hand, ‘Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you since the foundation of the world. 35 For I was hungry and you gave Me food, I was thirsty and you gave Me drink, I was a stranger and you took Me in. 36 I was naked and you clothed Me, I was sick and you visited Me, I was in prison and you came to Me.’<br>
    37 “Then the righteous will answer Him, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink? 38 When did we see You a stranger and take You in, or naked and clothe You? 39 And when did we see You sick or in prison and come to You?’<br>
    40 “The King will answer, ‘Truly I say to you, **as you have done it for one of the least of these brothers of Mine, you have done it for Me**.’

* Jesus will count our compassion for those in need as acts done for Him.

!!!
    41 “Then He will say to those at the left hand, ‘Depart from Me, you cursed, into the eternal fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. 42 For I was hungry and you gave Me no food, I was thirsty and you gave Me no drink, 43 I was a stranger and you did not take Me in, I was naked and you did not clothe Me, I was sick and in prison and you did not visit Me.’<br>
    44 “Then they also will answer Him, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not serve You?’<br>
    45 “He will answer, ‘Truly I say to you, **as you did it not for one of the least of these, you did it not for Me**.’

* Jesus will count lack of compassion as evidence of not caring for Him.

!!!
    46 **“And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life**.”

* The result of judging, or separating into sheep and goats, will be being sent to eternal punishment or to eternal life.
* Both options imply eternal existence, but in different places and under very different circumstances.

### Romans 2:6-11 eternal life or anguish according to the some principle for all
!!!
    5 But because of your hardness and impenitent heart, you are storing up treasures of wrath against yourself on the day of wrath when the righteous judgment of God will be revealed, 6 and He **“will render to every man according to his deeds**.” 7 To those who by **patiently doing good seek for glory and honor and immortality will be eternal life**. 8 But to those who are contentious and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation, and wrath, 9 will be **tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man who does evil**, to the Jew first, and then to the Gentile. 10 But glory, honor, and peace will be to every man who does good work—to the Jew first, and then to the Gentile, 11 for there is no partiality with God.

* Everyone will be judged. 
* Doing good and seeking honor will lead to eternal life.
* Doing evil will lead to tribulation and anguish.

### Matthew 6:19-21 store up treasures in heaven
!!!
    19 “Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal. 20 But **store up for yourselves treasures in heaven**, where neither moth nor rust destroy and where thieves do not break in nor steal, 

* What we do here on earth can result in treasures stored up in heaven.
* Implies that we can access and enjoy those treasures when we get to heaven.
    
!!!    
    21 for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

* Investing our money, time and energy into something (storing treasures) is what will shape our heart, our desires. So the motivation for investing in heavenly treasures is not primarily to get rich, but to guard and guide our heart. Heavenly riches are a nice side effect.

### 1 Thessalonians 4:13–17 the dead will be raised and united with Jesus
!!!
    13 But I would not have you ignorant, brothers, concerning those who are asleep, that you may not grieve as others who have no hope. 14 For if we believe that **Jesus died and arose again**, so **God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus**. 15 For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that **we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will not precede those who are asleep**. 16 For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet call of God. And **the dead in Christ will rise first**. 17 **Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them** in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so **we shall be forever with the Lord**.

* *Those who are asleep* are the ones dead in the grave.
* Just as God raised Jesus, He will raise those that died as believers.
* Dead believers will be united with Christ before believers that are alive when Jesus returns.
* All believers, past and present, will be with Jesus eternally.

### Isaiah 65:8-25 New Heavens and New Earth with the New Jerusalem
!!!
    <div style="white-space: pre;">   8 Thus says the Lord:    <br>
    As the new wine is found in the cluster,
        and one says, “Do not destroy it
        for a blessing is in it,”
    so **I will do for the sake of My servants
        that I may not destroy them all**.
    9 I will bring forth descendants from Jacob,
        and out of Judah an inheritor of My mountains;
    and **My chosen ones shall inherit it**,
        and **My servants shall dwell there**.
    10 Sharon shall be a fold of flocks,
        and the Valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in,
        for My people who seek Me.        <br>
    11 **But you are those who forsake the Lord**,
        who forget My holy mountain,
    who prepare a table for Fortune,
        and who furnish the drink offering for Destiny.
    12 **I will destine you for the sword**,
        and you all shall bow down to the slaughter;
    **because when I called, you did not answer;
        when I spoke, you did not hear
    but did evil before My eyes
        and chose that in which I did not delight**.        <br>
    13 Therefore, thus says the Lord God:        <br>
    **My servants shall eat,
        but you shall be hungry;
    My servants shall drink,
        but you shall be thirsty;
    My servants shall rejoice,
        but you shall be ashamed;
    14 My servants shall sing for joy
        with a glad heart,
    but you shall cry
        with a heavy heart
        and shall wail with grief of spirit**.
    15 You shall leave your name
        for a curse to My chosen ones;
    for the Lord God shall slay you,
        but My servants shall be called by another name;
    16 because he who is blessed in the earth
        shall bless himself in the God of truth;
    and he who swears in the earth
        shall swear by the God of truth;
    because the former troubles are forgotten
        and because they are hidden from My eyes.        <br>
    ***The New Creation***
    17 **For I create
        new heavens and a new earth**;
    the former things shall not be remembered
        or come to mind.
    18 But be glad and rejoice forever
        in that which I create;
    for** I create Jerusalem for rejoicing
        and her people for joy**.
    19 **I will rejoice in Jerusalem
        and be glad in My people;
    and the voice of weeping shall no longer be heard in her,
        nor the voice of crying**.        <br>
    20 **There shall no longer be
        an infant who lives only a few days
        nor an old man who has not filled out his days**.
    For the child shall die
        a hundred years old,
    but the sinner being a hundred years old
        shall be accursed.
    21 **They shall build houses and inhabit them;
        and they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them**.
    22 **They shall not build and another inhabit;
        they shall not plant and another eat;
    for as the days of a tree
        are the days of My people,
    and My chosen ones shall long enjoy
        the work of their hands**.
    23 **They shall not labor in vain
        nor bring forth children for trouble**;
    for they are the descendants of the blessed of the Lord
        and their offspring with them.
    24 **Before they call, I will answer;
        and while they are yet speaking, I will hear**.
    25 **The wolf and the lamb shall feed together,
        and the lion shall eat straw like the bull,
        and dust shall be the serpent’s food.
    They shall not hurt nor destroy
        in all My holy mountain,
        says the Lord**. </div>

* There will be *a new heavens* and *a new earth* with a *new Jerusalem* for believers to live in harmoniously with each other and in the presence of God.
* Even animals will change to be in harmony, with carnivore animals becoming vegetarian. 

### Revelation 21  New Heavens and New Earth with the New Jerusalem
!!!    
    21 Then I saw **“a new heaven and a new earth**.” For the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no more sea. 2 I, John, saw the Holy City, **the New Jerusalem**, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. 3 And I heard a loud voice from heaven, saying, “Look! **The tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them**. They shall be His people, and God Himself will be with them and be their God. 4 ‘**God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. There shall be no more death**.’ **Neither shall there be any more sorrow nor crying nor pain**, for the former things have passed away.”

* There will be *a new heavens* and *a new earth* with a *new Jerusalem* for believers to live in the presence of God and without pain and even without death.
* This sounds quite concrete, not metaphorical.

!!!
    5 He who was seated on the throne said, “Look! I am making all things new.” Then He said to me, “Write, for these words are faithful and true.”

    6 He said to me, “It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give of the spring of the water of life to him who thirsts. 7 He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son.[c] 8 But **the cowardly, the unbelieving, the abominable, the murderers, the sexually immoral, the sorcerers, the idolaters, and all liars shall have their portion in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone. This is the second death**.”

* Evil unbelievers will be cast into a lake that burns with fire and brimstone, their second death.
* Possibly also concrete and not metaphorical

!!!
    ***The New Jerusalem***
    9 One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came to me and said to me, “Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.” 10 And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the **Holy City, Jerusalem**, descending out of heaven from God, 11 having the glory of God, her light like a most precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal. 12 It had a great, high wall, with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and on the gates the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel were written: 13 three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west. 14 The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

    15 He who talked with me had a golden rod to measure the city and its gates and wall. 16 The city lies as a square, its length as long as its width. He measured the city with the rod: one thousand four hundred miles. Its length and breadth and height are equal. 17 He then measured its wall: two hundred feet by the measurement of a man, that is, of an angel. 18 The wall was built of jasper and the city was pure gold, as clear as glass. 19 The foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all kinds of precious jewels. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; 20 the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; and the twelfth, amethyst. 21 The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each of the gates made of a single pearl, and the street of the city was pure gold, transparent as glass.

* The New Jerusalem will be huge and luxurious

!!!
    22 I saw no temple in the city, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. 23 The city has no need of sun or moon to shine in it, for the glory of God is its light, and its lamp is the Lamb. 24 And the nations of those who are saved shall walk in its light, and the kings of the earth shall bring their glory and honor into it. 25 Its gates shall never be shut by day, for there shall be no night there. 26 They shall bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations. 27 No unclean thing shall ever enter it, nor shall anyone who commits abomination or falsehood, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s Book of Life.

* All of New Jerusalam will be a holy place, a place to honor God

## Conclusion

* We are of dualistic nature: physical body and immaterial soul.
* At death, our physical body dies, but our soul lives on.
* Based on our belief in Jesus as our Lord and Saviour, and our moral life in accordance with our belief, our soul will go to paradise or hades.
  * Paradise is a comfortable place where we are with Jesus
  * Hades is a place of torment
  * We can sense and communicate with each other in those places.
  * Once in Hades there is no crossing over to Paradise.
    * There are second, third and fourth etc. chances to change our destiny, but they are all before death. 
* At the second coming of Christ, dead believers will be raised, receiving a new resurrection body and being united with Christ.
  * The still-alive believers will be united with Christ as well.
* After Jesus has returned, everyone will be judged by Him. 
  * If our sin guilt was not paid by Jesus, because we rejected Him, then we will be destined for Hell, a lake of fire with eternal tourment.
  * If our sin guilt was already paid by Jesus then we will be destined to live in harmony and comfort in the new Heaven Jerusalem, a place that is Heaven on earth where we will live in the direct presence of God.
    * If we did something to help God's kingdom on earth then in Heaven / New Jerusalam we will enjoy additional treasures that have been stored up for us there.
