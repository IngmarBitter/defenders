# The Timeline of the Return of Christ

## That Christ will reign on Earth

There are various prophecies about a righteous descendant of Kind David being the Messiah, the Son of Man, that will reign on earth eternally bringing peace and justice. Jesus self-identifies as *the* Messiah, *the* Son of Man. 

### Isaiah 9:6-7 A child born, government upon his shoulder

!!!
    <div style="white-space: pre;">   6 For unto us **a child is born**,
        unto us a son is given,
        and **the government shall be **upon** his shoulder**.
    And his name shall be called
        Wonderful Counselor, **Mighty God**,
        Eternal Father, **Prince of Peace**.
    7 Of the increase **of his government and peace
        there shall be no end**,
    upon the **throne of David**
        and over his kingdom,
    to order it and to establish it
        with justice and with righteousness,
        **from now until forever**.
    The zeal of the Lord of Hosts
        will perform this.</div>

* Prophecy of a Davidic king who would be in charge of the government of Israel and who would bring about a reign of peace and justice and righteousness that would endure forever.

### Isaiah 11:1-10 The peaceful kingdom of the Messiah

!!!
    <div style="white-space: pre;">   6 And there shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse,
        and a Branch shall grow out of his roots.
    2 The Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him,
        the Spirit of wisdom and understanding,
        the Spirit of counsel and might,
        the Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord.<br>
    3 He shall delight in the fear of the Lord,
        and he shall not judge by what his eyes see,
        nor reprove by what his ears hear;
    4 but **with righteousness he shall judge** the poor,
        and reprove with fairness for the meek of the earth.
    He shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth,
        and with the breath of his lips **he shall slay the wicked**.
    5 Righteousness shall be the belt of his loins,
        and faithfulness the belt about his waist.<br>
    6 The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb,
        and the leopard shall lie down with the young goat,
    and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together;
        and a little child shall lead them.
    7 The cow and the bear shall graze;
        their young ones shall lie down together;
        and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
    8 The nursing child shall play by the hole of the asp,
        and the weaned child shall put his hand in the viper’s den.
    9 They shall not hurt or destroy
        in all My holy mountain,
    for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord,
        as the waters cover the sea.<br>
    10 In that day there shall be a Root of Jesse, who shall stand as a banner to the peoples. For him shall the nations seek. And his rest shall be glorious.</div>

* Prophecy of a descendent of Jesse, kind David's father, to become the righteous ruler bringing peace and justice to Israel - even peace between carnivore animals and their prey.
* The ruler was understood to be the Messiah, which the New Testament revealed was Jesus.

### Daniel 7:13-14 The Son of Man will be given dominion

!!!
    13 I saw in the night visions, and **there was one like a Son of Man coming with the clouds of heaven**. He came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before Him.  14 There was **given to Him dominion and glory, and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve Him**. His dominion is an **everlasting dominion**, which shall not pass away, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.

* Prophecy of the Ancient of Days, God, giving the Son of Man, everlasting dominion over the earth.
* The Ancient of Days refers to God the Father.

### Mark 14:61-62 Jesus claims the titles *Messiah* and *The Son of Man coming on the clouds*.

!!!
    "Again the high priest asked him, 'Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?' 'I am,' said Jesus. 'And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.'"

* Jesus claims the title *Messiah*.
* Jesus claims the title *The Son of Man coming on the clouds* from Daniel 7:13.

### Matthew 26:63-64 Jesus claims the titles *Messiah* and *at right hand of God* and *The Son of Man coming on the clouds*.

!!!
    "But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, 'I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God.' 'You have said so,' Jesus replied. 'But I say to all of you: From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.'"

* Jesus claims the title *Messiah*.
* Jesus claims the title *sitting at the right hand of God*.
* Jesus claims the title *The Son of Man coming on the clouds* from Daniel 7:13.

## When Christ will reign on Earth according to Jesus in Mark 13

In Mark 13 Jesus identifies as Son of Man coming in the clouds and teaches us that there are sure signs of his return, such as wars, earthquakes, famines, persecution, false Christs and false prophets. That implies the great tribulation is before Christ's return and Christians will have to suffer through it.

### Mark 13:1-2 The destruction of the temple foretold

!!!
    1 As He went out of the temple, one of His disciples said to Him, “Teacher, see what great stones and what great buildings are here.”

    2 Jesus answered him, “Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone shall be left upon another that shall not be thrown down.”

* Prophecy by Jesus about the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem. 
* Fulfilled in 70 AD by the Roman army under General Titus who destroyed the Second Temple during the First Jewish-Roman War. The temple's destruction marked the end of the Jewish revolt and had a significant impact on Judaism, as the temple had been the center of Jewish worship and sacrifice.

### Mark 13:3-13 End times signs

!!!
    3 As He sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked Him privately, 4 “Tell us, **when will these things happen**, and **what will be the sign** when all these things will be fulfilled?”

    5 Jesus answered them, “Take heed lest anyone deceive you. 6 **Many will come in My name, saying, ‘I am He,’ and will deceive many**. 7 When you hear of **wars** and rumors of wars, do not be troubled. For such things must happen, but the end is still to come. 8 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be **earthquakes** in various places, and there will be **famines** and **troubles**. These are the beginning of sorrows.

    9 “But take heed. For they will hand you over to councils, and in the synagogues you will be beaten. **You will be brought before rulers and kings for My sake**, as a testimony to them. 10 And **the gospel must first be preached to all nations**. 11 But when they arrest you and hand you over, take no thought beforehand, or premeditate what you should speak. But speak whatever is given you in that time, for it is not you who speaks, but the Holy Spirit.

    12 “Now a **brother will betray his brother to death**, and **the father the son**; **children will rise up against their parents**, and will cause them to be put to death. 13 **You will be hated by all men for My name’s sake**. But he who endures to the end shall be saved.

* The signs are
  * Many claiming to be Jesus, deceiving believers
  * Wars, earthquakes, famines, troubles
  * The gospel preached to all nations (not necessarily all people)
  * Deadly betrayal within families
  * Hate for Christians because of our belief in Christ
* Some of these signs, such as various wars between various nations and the preaching the gospel to all nations imply that Jesus is not answering with regard to the temple destruction but more general to the end times.
* All of those signs have occurred to some degree. It's not clear how obviously those signs must be present. In 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4 another sign is that the Antichrist must claim to be God himself. That at least seems to not have occurred yet. 
  
#### 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4

!!!
    3 Do not let anyone deceive you in any way. For **that Day will not come unless** a falling away comes first, and **the man of sin is revealed**, the son of destruction, 4 who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or is worshipped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, **claiming that he himself is God**.

* Unfulfilled end times sign: the antichrist has to be revealed, selfidentify as God and being worshiped as such

#### Daniel 9:27 Abomination of desolation

!!!
    <div style="white-space: pre;">   27 He will make a firm covenant
    with many for one week,
    but in the middle of the week
    he will put a stop to sacrifice and offering.
    And the **abomination of desolation**
    will be on a wing of the temple
    until the decreed destruction
    is poured out on the desolator.”</div>

* *"Abomination of desolation"* generally refers to a desecrating act or object that leads to the desolation of a holy place, specifically the temple in Jerusalem. 
* One interpretation, based on historical events, associates the "*abomination of desolation*" with the desecration of the Second Temple by the Seleucid ruler Antiochus IV Epiphanes in 167 BC. Antiochus outlawed Jewish religious practices, installed a statue of Zeus in the temple, and sacrificed swine on the altar, which was considered an abomination in Jewish law. This event led to the Maccabean Revolt and the eventual rededication of the temple.
* In the context of Jesus' reference to the "*abomination of desolation*" in the New Testament (Mark 13:14, Matthew 24:15), it is often associated with the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD by the Roman army, which may be seen as another instance of the "*abomination of desolation*."
* Some interpretations of the "*abomination of desolation*" in Daniel 9:27 extend to end-time prophecies and associate the phrase with the actions of a future Antichrist figure, who will desecrate the temple and persecute the people of God during a time of tribulation before the return of Christ.

### Mark 13:14-23 Flee from the Abomination of Desolation and False Christs

!!!
    14 “When you see the **‘abomination of desolation’** spoken of by Daniel the prophet standing where it should not be (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. 15 Let him who is on the housetop not go down or enter the house to take anything out of his house. 16 Let him who is in the field not turn back to take his garment. 17 But woe to women who are pregnant and to those who nurse in those days! 18 Pray that your escape may not be in winter. 19 For in those days there will be tribulation [trouble, distress, misery, suffering] as has not been from the beginning of the creation which God created to this time, nor ever shall be.

    20 “Except the Lord shortened the days, no flesh would be saved. But for the sake of the elect, whom He chose, He shortened the days. 21 Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘Look, there He is!’ do not believe it. 22 For false christs and false prophets will rise and show signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. 23 But take heed. I have told you all things beforehand.

* When the *Abomination of Desolation* is being observed, then Christians should immediately flee from being out in the open.
* There will be great tribulation / suffering.
* There will be false Christs and false prophets and Christians should be watchful not to be lead astray.
* Since in the preceeding section v3-13 Jesus widened the scope to future endtimes, this section should also be yet to be fulfilled.
  * Unfortunately that makes it hard to pin down what exactly will be the future *Abomination of Desolation*.
* Interpretations of the *Abomination of Desolation* and end-time events can vary significantly among different Christian denominations and individuals. The key takeaway from this passage is the importance of remaining vigilant and faithful in the face of adversity and deception.

#### Isaiah 13:10

!!!
    <div style="white-space: pre;">   For the stars of heaven and their constellations
        shall not give their light;
    the sun shall be dark when it rises,
        and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.</div>

* Prophecy of total darkness.

### Mark 13:24-27 The Son of Man coming in clouds, dispelling the darkness

!!!
    <div style="white-space: pre;">   24 “But in those days, after that distress,
    **‘the sun will be darkened,
        and the moon will not give her light**;
    25 the stars of heaven will fall,
        and the powers that are in heaven will be shaken.’</div>

    26 “Then they will see the **Son of Man coming in clouds** with great power and glory. 27 Then He will send His angels and **gather His elect** from the four winds, from the farthest part of the earth to the farthest part of heaven.

* 24-25 quote Isaiah 13:10, refer to coming total darkness
* 26 has the Son of Man coming in the clouds highly visible, so he must bring light with him to dispell the darkness and be able to be seen
* 27 talks abount gathering the elect. Hard to tell if that refers to the dead, the alive or both. But at face value it is timeless, so refers to both.

### Mark 13:28-31 Parable of the fig tree & the certainty of Jesus' return

!!!
    28 “Now learn a parable of the fig tree: When her branch is yet tender and puts outs leaves, you know that summer is near. 29 So also, when you see these things come to pass, know that it is near, even at the doors. 30 Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things happen. 31 Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away.

* The certainty of summer approaching when the fig tree blossoms is an explanatory metaphor for the certainty of Jesus return approaching when those end times signs are being observed

### Mark 13:32-37 The unknown hour and call to watchfulness

!!!
    32 “But concerning **that day or hour no one knows**, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, **but only the Father**. 33 Take heed, watch and pray. For you do not know when the time will come. 34 For the Son of Man is like a man leaving on a far journey who left his house and gave authority to his servants and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.

    35 “**Watch therefore** — for you do not know when the master of the house is coming, in the evening, or at midnight, or at the crowing of the rooster, or in the morning — 36 **lest he come suddenly and find you sleeping**. 37 What I say to you I say to all: Watch!”

* We cannot know the day and time Christ will return.
* We should live such that we are ready for His return any time.
  * The signs of 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4 are still not here yet
  * Nonetheless, we should be watchful and live according to our believes, meaning according to the wisdom and commands in the Bible.


## Many views

### The Rapture view

### The Preterist view

### Premillennialism

This view holds that Jesus will physically return to earth before the millennium to establish His kingdom. The millennium will be a literal thousand-year period during which Jesus will rule the earth, and believers will be resurrected to reign with Him.

* Pros:
  * Aligns with a more literal interpretation of Revelation 20:1-6.
  * Emphasizes the importance of Jesus' physical presence on earth.
* Cons:
  * Some argue that this view requires a complex sequence of events, including multiple resurrections and judgments.
  * Critics claim that this interpretation may lead to an overly apocalyptic focus.

### Amillennialism

This perspective sees the millennium as symbolic, representing the entire Church Age, which began with Jesus' first coming and will end with His second coming. Jesus' reign is spiritual, and believers are currently reigning with Him in heaven

* Pros:
  * Provides a simpler and more unified interpretation of end-time events.
  * Emphasizes the spiritual aspect of Jesus' reign.
* Cons:
  * Relies on a more symbolic interpretation of Revelation 20:1-6.
  * May downplay the significance of Jesus' physical return to earth.

### Postmillennialism

This view holds that the millennium will be a period of peace and righteousness on earth, brought about by the gradual influence of the Gospel. Jesus will return physically after the millennium, and believers will be resurrected at that time

* Pros:
  * Highlights the transformative power of the Gospel.
  * Emphasizes the importance of Christians working for peace and justice.
* Cons:
  * Requires a more optimistic view of human progress, which may not align with the reality of ongoing conflicts and moral decline.
  * Some argue that this interpretation does not fit well with other biblical passages about end-time events.

## Jesus' Millennial Reign

### Revelation 20

!!!
    1 And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. 2 He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years. 3 He cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal on him, that he should deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years were ended. After that he must be set free for a little while.<br>
    4 I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and the authority to judge was given to them. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness of Jesus and for the word of God. They had not worshipped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. 5 The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection. 6 Blessed and holy is he who takes part in the first resurrection. Over these the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with Him a thousand years.
