# Doctrine of Christ Summary and Practical Takeaways

---

## The Doctrine of Christ (In One View)

* The doctrine of Christ is about:
  * **Who Jesus is** (incarnation)
  * **What Jesus did** (death and resurrection)
  * **How salvation is received** (access)

---

## Four Pillars

* Incarnation: fully God and fully man
* Death: atonement addressing guilt, justice, and reconciliation
* Resurrection: vindication, evidence, and future hope
* Access: Christ as the saving doorway, and God’s justice and mercy toward all peoples

---

## A Useful Apologetic Pattern

* Craig distinguishes two complementary routes:
  * Existential knowledge (encounter and discipleship)
  * Evidential knowledge (historical reasoning)
* A common structure:
  * Establish key facts
  * Infer the best explanation

---

## Discipleship Implications

* Worship
  * Jesus is worthy because of who he is
* Hope
  * Resurrection reframes suffering and death
* Holiness
  * Christ’s death is not only pardon, but transformation
* Mission
  * If access is through Christ, love compels proclamation
