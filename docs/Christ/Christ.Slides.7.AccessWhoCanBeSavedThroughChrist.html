# Access: Who Can Be Saved Through Christ?

---

## The Question

* If Christ’s work is the only atonement
  * Who can benefit from it?
* The pastoral and apologetic pressure point:
  * What about those who never hear the gospel?

---

## The Biblical Case for Particularism

* The New Testament presents salvation as through Christ
  * Not “many independent roads”
* Craig contrasts particularism with religious pluralism
  * Pluralism often functions as the default view in modern culture

---

## Pluralism: Two Forms

* Unsophisticated pluralism
  * “All religions are equally true”
  * Self-refuting because religions make mutually exclusive claims
* Sophisticated pluralism
  * “All are equally false but equally effective”
  * Needs careful evaluation and evidence

---

## The Real Problem: The Unevangelized

* Craig distinguishes sub-questions:
  * Would a loving God send anyone to hell?
  * Is eternal punishment unjust?
  * Is it unfair to judge those who never heard?
* He argues God judges persons by response to general revelation
  * Christ’s atonement can apply without conscious knowledge of Christ

---

## The Logical Challenge

* A common argument claims these cannot both be true:
  * God is all-powerful and all-loving
  * Some never hear and are lost
* Craig targets the hidden assumptions
  * God cannot make someone freely choose
  * A world of universal salvation may not be feasible

---

## Middle Knowledge Solution (Outline)

* God knows what every possible person would freely do
* God can providentially order history so that:
  * Those who would respond are placed where they will hear
  * Those who never hear and are lost would not have believed anyway
* This supports missions rather than undermining them
  * “Divine appointments” in evangelism
