# Christ’s Death: Sacrifice, Propitiation, and Redemption

---

## The Work of Christ

* The doctrine of Christ includes:
  * Person (incarnation)
  * Work (atonement, resurrection, salvation applied)
* Christ’s death is described with many biblical images
  * Craig treats these as complementary motifs, not competing “one-verse” theories

---

## Sacrifice

* Atonement is often expressed in sacrificial categories
  * Temple, priesthood, blood, offering
* Two closely related ideas:
  * **Expiation:** dealing with sin and guilt
  * **Propitiation:** dealing with God’s righteous opposition to sin

---

## Propitiation and Divine Justice

* Christ’s death is not only moral example
  * It addresses real guilt before a holy Judge
* A “legal / forensic” dimension matters
  * Justification, condemnation, pardon

---

## Redemption

* Redemption language frames salvation as liberation
  * From sin, death, and the powers opposed to God
* Ransom imagery is powerful, but must be integrated
  * It cannot replace justice and guilt categories

---

## Multiple Facets, One Gospel

* Classic motifs Craig integrates:
  * Sacrifice (expiation/propitiation)
  * Satisfaction of divine justice
  * Penal substitution
  * Redemption / victory
  * Moral influence (real, but not sufficient alone)

---

## Practical Takeaways

* Christ’s death is:
  * Objective (something Christ does for us)
  * Personal (calls for faith and repentance)
  * Transformative (new life and holiness)
