# The Incarnation: Two Natures, One Person

---

## The Son Is Truly God

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -1.5em;"> <em>John 1:1 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily;"</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Colossians 2:9 (NKJV)</em></p>

* The Word is God (deity is affirmed, not merely similarity)
* The fullness of deity dwells in Christ bodily
* Therefore: any Christology must preserve **full deity**

---

## The Son Truly Became Human

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -1.5em;"> <em>John 1:14 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"By this you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God, and every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. And this is the spirit of the Antichrist, which you have heard was coming, and is now already in the world."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>1 John 4:2–3 (NKJV)</em></p>

* The Word became flesh (real incarnation, not appearance)
* Confessing Jesus Christ "has come in the flesh" is a basic Christian test
* Therefore: any Christology must preserve **true humanity**

---

## The Biblical Data (Non-Negotiables)

* The New Testament affirms both **deity** and **humanity** of Christ
  * The Son is truly God (e.g., John 1:1; Colossians 2:9)
  * The Son truly became human (e.g., John 1:14; 1 John 4:2–3)
* Orthodoxy insists on both without compromise
  * Deny deity → not Christian theism
  * Deny humanity → no real incarnation, no real suffering, no real redemption

---

## Human Growth and Learning

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -1.5em;"> <em>Luke 2:52 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"though He was a Son, yet He learned obedience by the things which He suffered."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Hebrews 5:8 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Jesus' human life includes genuine growth and development
* "Learned obedience" implies real human experience (not pretense)

---

## A Limitation Text (Human Consciousness)

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Mark 13:32 (NKJV)</em></p>

* The Son is said not to know the day/hour
* This gives us a clear example of human limitation to be explained by our model

---

## The Temptation Paradox

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -1.5em;"> <em>Hebrews 4:15 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"Let no one say when he is tempted, 'I am tempted by God'; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>James 1:13 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Christ was genuinely tempted (Hebrews 4:15) — yet God cannot be tempted (James 1:13)
* This tension requires a model that preserves both truths
* Any adequate Christology must explain how temptation is real without implying the possibility of sin

---

## Physical Limitations

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied from His journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -1.5em;"> <em>John 4:6 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, 'I thirst!'"</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>John 19:28 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Jesus experienced genuine physical fatigue and thirst
* These are not "performances" but real bodily limitations

---

## Real Suffering and Death

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"Inasmuch then as the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same, that through death He might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,"</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Hebrews 2:14 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Christ shared in flesh and blood so that He could truly die
* His death was real, not apparent, and purposeful: to destroy the power of death

---

## Jesus' True Humanity

* Human birth, growth, and development (Luke 2:52)
* Temptation and testing (Hebrews 4:15)
* Physical limitations: hunger, thirst, fatigue (John 4:6; 19:28)
* Genuine human psychology and cognition
  * Growth and learning (Hebrews 5:8)
  * Epistemic limits in His earthly consciousness (Mark 13:32)
* Real suffering and real death (Hebrews 2:14)

---

## The Tension In One Person

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily;"</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -1.5em;"> <em>Colossians 2:9 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Mark 13:32 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Full deity is affirmed
* Genuine limitation is also affirmed
* Therefore: we must explain these without contradiction or denial

---

## The Apparent Contradiction (Incompatible Predicates)

* How can one person be both:
  * Creator and creature?
  * Necessary/eternal and yet mortal?
  * Omniscient and yet "the Son does not know" (Mark 13:32)?
  * Omnipresent and yet bodily located in Palestine?
* The classical confession: **truly God and truly man**
  * Not successive "stages" (God → man → God)
  * Simultaneously divine and human

# False Models

---

## The Historical Heresies

* The early church faced errors from every direction:
  * **Docetism:** Christ only *seemed* human (no real flesh)
  * **Apollinarianism:** Christ's human mind replaced by the Logos
  * **Nestorianism:** Christ split into two persons
  * **Eutychianism:** Christ's natures blended into one
  * **Radical Kenosis:** the Logos strips away His divine attributes
  * **Metamorphosis:** God turns into a man, then turns back
* Each heresy preserves part of the truth while sacrificing the rest

---

## Docetism: Only Seeming Human

![](pics/FalseModel.Docetism.png style="float: right; width: 14rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>John 1:1 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Christ's deity so exalted, real flesh seemed impossible
* **Teaching:** Christ only *appeared* to have a body — no real flesh, suffering, or death
* **Proponents:** Gnostic groups (2nd century) who deprecated the material world
* **The distortion:** eliminates true humanity entirely

---

## Why Docetism Fails

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"By this you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God, and every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>1 John 4:2–3 (NKJV)</em></p>

* The apostolic test itself excludes Docetism
* No real humanity → no real death → no real redemption (Hebrews 2:14)
* No real humanity → no genuine sympathy with our weaknesses (Hebrews 4:15)

---

## Apollinarianism: A Mind Replaced

![](pics/FalseModel.Apollinarianism.png style="float: right; width: 14rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -2em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Hebrews 4:15 (NKJV)</em></p>

* If Christ was "without sin," perhaps a fallible human mind was the problem
* **Teaching:** The Logos replaces the human rational soul; Christ has a body but no human mind
* **Proponent:** Apollinarius, Bishop of Laodicea (died ~390)
* **Advantage:** preserves unity and explains sinlessness
* **The distortion:** Christ's humanity is truncated — body without mind

---

## Why Apollinarianism Fails

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"For indeed He does not give aid to angels, but He does give aid to the seed of Abraham. Therefore, in all things He had to be made like His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Hebrews 2:16–17 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Gregory of Nazianzus: "What is not assumed is not saved"
  * If Christ lacks a human mind, the human mind is unredeemed
* Without a human mind, no genuine sympathy with our struggles (Hebrews 4:15)
* Condemned at the Synod of Rome, 377

---

## Nestorianism: Two Persons in One Body?

![](pics/FalseModel.Nestorianism.png style="float: right; width: 14rem; margin-top: -1.0em")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Mark 13:32 (NKJV)</em></p>

* How can one person be both omniscient God and ignorant of the hour? Perhaps two persons
* **Teaching:** Full deity and full humanity, but two persons, not union
* **Proponent:** Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople (428)
  * Refused to call Mary *Theotokos* ("God-bearer")
  * Insisted Mary bore only the man Jesus, not the divine Logos
* **The distortion:** two persons — Christ's unity dissolved

---

## Why Nestorianism Fails

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"But why is this granted to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?"</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Luke 1:43 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Elizabeth calls Mary "the mother of my Lord" — not "the mother of a man indwelt by the Lord"
* If you cannot say "Mary bore God incarnate," you have split Christ into two persons
* The Council of Ephesus (431) affirmed *Theotokos* to safeguard the unity of Christ's person

---

## Eutychianism: Natures Confused

![](pics/FalseModel.Eutychianism.png style="float: right; width: 14rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -2em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>John 1:14 (NKJV)</em></p>

* If the Word "became" flesh, perhaps the two natures fused into one
* **Teaching:** After the incarnation the two natures merge into one divine-human nature
* **Proponent:** Eutyches, monk in Constantinople (~448); Alexandrian school tendency
* **The distortion:** neither truly God nor truly man — a confused other

---

## Why Eutychianism Fails

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily;"</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -1.5em;"> <em>Colossians 2:9 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>John 1:14 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Full deity preserved (Colossians 2:9) and real flesh assumed (John 1:14) — not a blend
* The Council of Chalcedon (451): "without confusion, without change"

---

## Radical Kenosis: Deity Subtracted

![](pics/FalseModel.RadicalKenosis.png style="float: right; width: 14rem; margin-top: -1.0em")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Philippians 2:7 (ESV)</em></p>

* If Christ "emptied Himself," perhaps He literally gave up divine attributes
* **Teaching:** In becoming human, the Logos literally divests Himself of divine attributes (omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence)
* **Proponents:** 19th-century kenotic theologians
* **The distortion:** incarnation as subtraction — God gives up being God

---

## Why Radical Kenosis Fails

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily;"</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Colossians 2:9 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Craig: Colossians 2:9 "shipwrecks Kenoticism" — *all* the fullness of deity dwells in Christ bodily
* If the Logos gives up attributes essential to deity, He ceases to be God
* Philippians 2 describes a change of *status* — humiliation to exaltation — not loss of *essence*

---

## Metamorphosis: Successive Stages

![](pics/FalseModel.Metamorphosis.png style="float: right; width: 14rem; margin-top: -1.0em")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. [...] Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name,"</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -2em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Philippians 2:7–9 (ESV)</em></p>

* Philippians 2 as temporal stages: divine → human → divine again
* **Teaching:** Christ was purely divine, then became purely human, then returned to purely divine
* A pagan-style transformation: God turns into a man, then turns back
* A temporary episode, not a permanent union
* **The distortion:** Christ is never *simultaneously* God and man

---

## Why Metamorphosis Fails

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"This same Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will so come in like manner as you saw Him go into heaven."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -1.5em;"> <em>Acts 1:11 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus,"</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>1 Timothy 2:5 (NKJV)</em></p>

* "This same Jesus" — continuity of person and nature through the ascension
* "The Man Christ Jesus" — present tense, post-ascension; Christ retains His human nature forever
* The incarnation is permanent: God has forever dignified human nature by assuming it

---

## Incarnation as Mirror of the Trinity

* The **Trinity**: multiple persons sharing one divine nature
* The **Incarnation**: multiple natures united in one divine person
* This structural parallel illuminates both doctrines
  * Trinity guards against dividing the Godhead; Incarnation guards against dividing Christ
  * Both require "without confusion, without separation" thinking

---

## Craig's Proposed Model (Three Planks)

* (1) One person with two complete natures
* (2) The Logos Himself is the mind of Christ's human nature — one person, not two
* (3) During His earthly life, divine knowledge is beneath a genuinely human consciousness

---

## Plank 1: One Person, Two Complete Natures

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"though He was a Son, yet He learned obedience by the things which He suffered."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Hebrews 5:8 (NKJV)</em></p>

* **Nature 1 — Humanity:** the kind essence that makes someone human
* **Nature 2 — Deity:** the kind essence that makes someone divine
* The Logos possesses **deity essentially** and **humanity contingently**
* The incarnation is **addition, not subtraction** — the Logos does not cease to be God
* Reduplicative predication resolves apparent contradictions
  * Christ **learned obedience** *with respect to* His human nature
  * Christ is **omnipresent** *with respect to* His divine nature

---

## Plank 2: The Logos as Archetype of Humanity

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"Then God said, 'Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness [...]' So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Genesis 1:26–27 (NKJV)</em></p>

* The *Imago Dei*: humans bear God's image in rationality, self-consciousness, and freedom
* Craig's insight: the Logos already possesses these capacities archetypally
* In the incarnation, the Logos assumes a human nature brought to completeness through union with Him
* One person (not two) because the Logos *is* the rational soul

---

## Plank 3: The Subconscious Self

* William James: consciousness has subconscious depths beneath waking awareness
  * Your conscious and subconscious mind don't make you two persons
* Craig's application: during the state of humiliation, the Logos' divine knowledge and power are largely **subconscious**
  * Like an iceberg — the bulk of divine cognition is submerged beneath Jesus' waking human consciousness
* Jesus' human mind develops genuinely — learning and growing
* Occasionally the divine subconscious surfaces (e.g., knowing Nathanael under the fig tree, John 1:48)

---

## Gethsemane: The Model in Action

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">"'Father, if it is Your will, take this cup away from Me; nevertheless not My will, but Yours, be done.' Then an angel appeared to Him from heaven, strengthening Him. And being in agony, He prayed more earnestly. Then His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground."</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1.25em; margin-bottom: -0.75em;"> <em>Luke 22:42–44 (NKJV)</em></p>

* The subconscious model preserves the authenticity of Gethsemane
  * Real anguish in prayer — not a performance
  * Genuine moral struggle and submission to the Father's will
* Christ's dependence on the Father is moment-by-moment, not theatrical
* The incarnation means God knows suffering from the inside

---

## True God and True Man

<img src="pics/Trinity.and.JesusTrueGodTrueMan.png" style="display: block; margin: -1.4em auto 0; max-height: 90%; max-width: 100%;">

* *Incarnation: divine knowledge is subconscious — present but beneath awareness*

---

## Practical Takeaways

* The incarnation safeguards:
  * God's nearness and sympathy in suffering
  * The meaningfulness of Christ's death (real death)
  * The hope of resurrection (transformed humanity)
* True God and true man — a valid substitute, guaranteeing our atonement and future in heaven
* Christology is not abstract
  * It structures worship, prayer, and obedience
