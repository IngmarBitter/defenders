# The Resurrection: Biblical Evidence

---

## Why Resurrection Matters

* The resurrection is not an optional appendix
  * It vindicates Jesus’ identity and mission
  * It confirms the saving significance of Christ’s death
  * It grounds Christian hope and future resurrection

---

## Paul’s Early Tradition (1 Corinthians 15)

* Paul “received and delivered” a very early tradition
  * Christ died, was buried, was raised, and appeared
* The emphasis is on public witness
  * Named individuals and groups
  * A community that can check testimony

---

## The Resurrection Body (1 Corinthians 15)

* Continuity through transformation
  * Not mere resuscitation
* “Spiritual body” does not mean immaterial
  * It means Spirit-empowered, imperishable life

---

## A Historical Case: Three “Facts to Be Explained”

* Craig summarizes the evidence under three headings:
  * The empty tomb
  * Post-mortem appearances
  * The origin of the disciples’ resurrection belief

---

## Empty Tomb (Headings)

* Burial traditions imply a known tomb location
* Multiple early sources
* Women as primary witnesses in the narratives
* Early Jewish polemic presupposes an empty tomb

---

## Appearances and the Rise of Faith

* Multiple appearance traditions
  * Individuals and groups
  * Friends and former skeptics
* The disciples’ belief needs explanation
  * Crucifixion should have ended messianic expectation
