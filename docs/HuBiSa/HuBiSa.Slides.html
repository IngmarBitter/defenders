# HuBiSa — Blue Alternatives Feedback

---

## What Is This About?

![](ColorHuBiSaCircleSwatchWithNames.png style="float: right; width: 12rem")

* I'm building a color system called **HuBiSa**
* It organizes colors by three things you can easily understand:
  * **Hue** — which color (red, blue, green, …)
  * **Brightness** — how light or dark
  * **Saturation** — how vivid or washed-out
* Today I need your help with **one specific problem: blue**

## The Color Picker

![](ColorHuBiSaCircleSwatchWithNames.png style="float: right; width: 14rem")

* **Center:** black, white, and five grays
* **Rings:** eight named hues at five brightness levels
  * Darkest → Dark → Medium → Bright → Brightest
* **Corners:** saturation varies from gray → dull → vivid
* All these colors are designed to look **evenly spaced** to your eyes

## What Does "Perception Uniform" Mean?

![](ColorHuBiSaCircleSwatchWithNames.png style="float: right; width: 12rem")

* A color grid is **perception uniform** when:
  * **Brightness:** each step from dark to bright looks like the same size step — like a staircase with equal height stairs
  * **Hue:** going around the color circle, each color step looks the same distance apart, and all hues appear equally bright and equally saturated
  * **Saturation:** each step from gray to vivid looks like the same size step

## Why Blue Is Special

![](ColorHuBiSaCircleSwatchWithNames.png style="float: right; width: 12rem")

* Most colors behave well when you go from dark → bright
* **Blue is the exception** — when you darken blue toward black, it wants to drift toward **purple**
* There is no single "correct" fix — it requires choosing a path that **looks** the most blue at every brightness level
* That's where I need your eyes

## What You'll See Next

![](HuBiSaSpawningColors.221.png style="float: right; width: 14rem")

* Five slides, each with a slightly different blue
* The hue number in the title tells them apart (215–229)
* Focus on the **blue column** — does it stay blue from dark to bright?
* Some will look more purple-ish, some more cyan-ish
* I want to know which one looks the most like normal **blue**
* This looks different on different displays. On your phone go to tinyurl.com/CreeksideDefenders and then click on HuBiSa

## Your Vote

![](HuBiSaSpawningColors.221.png style="float: right; width: 14rem")

* Which hue number looked the most uniform to you?
  * 215, 218, 221, 225, or 229?
* Any brightness level that looked "wrong" in any of them?
* Feel free to flip back through the five slides to compare

## What Happens Next

* I'll collect everyone's preferred hue number
* The most popular choice becomes the default blue in HuBiSa
* You are contributing to research in color spaces
* Thank you!
