* Perfect being theology: God is morally perfect by definition.  

---

## Key Questions

![](OmniPics/GodHoly.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* What is the relationship between God and the Good?  
* What is the content of God's perfect goodness?  
* Biblical perspective on divine goodness.

* Meanings:  
  * Material blessing  
  * Desirability, pleasantness, beauty  
  * Quality or expense  
  * Moral goodness  
  * Well-being ("the good life")

## Righteousness and Holiness

![](OmniPics/GodHoly.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **Righteousness** (*s.edeq*, *dikaiosynē theou*):  
  * Dual aspects: Love and Justice.  
  * OT: God as Judge and Ruler, establishing moral order.  
  * Positive (salvific) and negative (punitive) senses.  
  * "God is love" (<span style="font-family:Gabriola;font-size:1.2em">1 John 4:8 NKJV</span>) + hatred of sin.  
* **Holiness** (*qōdesh*):  
  * Absolute purity.  
  * Separation from sin.

## God's Righteousness: Romans 9:14-21

![](OmniPics/GodHoly.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? Certainly not! For He says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whomever I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I will have compassion.” So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy. ... Who are you to reply against God? Will the thing formed say to him who formed it, “Why have you made me like this?” Does not the potter have power over the clay...?
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;"> <em>Romans 9:14-21 (NKJV)</em></p>

* God is the ultimate standard of righteousness; no higher appeal.
* His mercy and justice are sovereign and unquestionable.
