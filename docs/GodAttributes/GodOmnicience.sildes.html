## Psalm 139:1-6 on Omniscience

![](OmniPics/GodAndWorldDetails.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    O LORD, You have searched me and known me. You know my sitting down and my rising up; You understand my thought afar off.<br>
    You comprehend my path and my lying down, <br> and are acquainted with all my ways.<br>
    For there is not a word on my tongue, <br> But behold, O LORD, You know it altogether.
    You have hedged me behind and before, And laid Your hand upon me.
    Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; It is high, I cannot attain it.
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Psalm 139:1-6 (NKJV)</em></p>

* A poetic marvel at God’s knowledge  
* God sees everything that happens, nothing escapes His awareness
* From the ends of the earth to the tiniest details  
* God loves and knows us better than our most trusted friend

---

## God Knows All Events

![](OmniPics/GodAndWorldDetails.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "For He looks to the ends of the earth,  
    And sees under the whole heavens."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em;">    <em>Job 28:24 (NKJV)</em></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "The eyes of the LORD are in every place,  
    Keeping watch on the evil and the good."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em;">    <em>Proverbs 15:3 (NKJV)</em></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "But the very hairs of your head are all numbered."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Matthew 10:30 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Evidence of God’s awareness of all events
* Includes both the grand and the minute

---

## God Knows Our Thoughts

![](OmniPics/GodBooksAndHearts.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "The Lord searches all hearts and understands  
    all the intent of the thoughts."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em;">    <em>1 Chronicles 28:9 (NKJV)</em></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "The heart is deceitful above all things,  
    And desperately wicked; Who can know it?  
    I, the Lord, search the heart,  
    I test the mind, Even to give every man  
    according to his ways, According to the fruit of his doings."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Jeremiah 17:9-10 (NKJV)</em></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    [...] all things are naked and open to the eyes  
    of Him to whom we must give account."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -2em;">    <em>Hebrews 4:13 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Inner motives and plans laid bare  
* He searches every heart
* God reads the secret thoughts of every person (also see Psalm 94:11)

---

## God Knows the Future

![](OmniPics/GodBooksAndTime.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "For I am God, and there is no other;  
    I am God, and there is none like Me,  
    Declaring the end from the beginning,  
    And from ancient times things that are not yet done,  
    Saying, ‘My counsel shall stand,  
    And I will do all My pleasure.’"  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Isaiah 46:9b-10 (NKJV)</em></p>

* God’s unique ability to declare the future  
* His plans and purposes always prevail  
* Demonstrates His sovereignty and omniscience
* Also seen in prophecies like Daniel 2 or Christ’s birth (Micah 5:2)

---

## Foreknowledge Proves Deity

![](OmniPics/GodBooksAndTime.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    Let them bring forth and show us what will happen; ...<br>
    Declare to us the things to come<br>
    ... that we may know that you are gods."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Isaiah 41:22-23 (NKJV)</em></p>

* God challenges the little g gods to tell the future  
* They cannot, thus they are not really divine  
* Foreknowledge of the future distinguishes the true God
* Fulfilled prophecy (e.g. fall of Babylon, Isaiah 13) proves His deity
* Hard to explain on Open Theism  
  * (where God does not know the future)  

---

## God Knows Our Future Choices

![](OmniPics/EveReachingForFruit.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "Even before a word is on my tongue,  
    Behold, O Lord, You know it altogether."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -2em;">    <em>Psalm 139:4 (NKJV)</em></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    Your eyes saw my substance, being yet unformed.  
    And in Your book they all were written,  
    The days fashioned for me,  
    When as yet there were none of them.  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -2em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Psalm 139:16 (NKJV)</em></p>

* God foreknows the words we will choose to say  
* God writes our biography before we’re born  
* ?! Foreknowledge reflects, not dictates, our choices
* ?! Foreknowledge does not remove free will  
  * e.g., My friends know I will freely choose chocolate  

---

## Jesus Knows the Future

![](OmniPics/JesusBooksTime.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "Jesus said to him, 'Assuredly, I say to you that this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.'"  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -2em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Matthew 26:34 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "Jesus answered, 'It is he to whom I shall give a piece of bread when I have dipped it.' And having dipped the bread, He gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -2em;">    <em>John 13:26 (NKJV)</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "Now as He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, 'Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?'"  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -2em;">    <em>Matthew 24:3 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Jesus predicted:  
  * Peter’s denial, Judas’ betrayal, signs of the end times  
* Demonstrates divine omniscience  

---

## God Knows Hypothetical What-If Truths

![](OmniPics/GodRoadFork.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    David inquired of the Lord about saving Keilah from the Philistines, and God assured him of victory.  
    After defeating the Philistines, David learned that Saul planned to attack Keilah.  
    David asked God if Saul would come and if the people of Keilah would betray him.  
    God revealed that both would happen, so David and his men fled.  
    Saul was informed of this and turned his army around.  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>1 Samuel 23:1-13, summarized</em></p>

* God knew what **would** happen **if** David stayed: Saul would attack  
* However, David left, so it did not occur  
* This shows God’s knowledge of what would occur under hypothetical circumstances  

---

## God Knows Intentional What-If Truths

![](OmniPics/GodForkIntentional.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    And He said to them, “Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” So they cast, and now they were not able to draw it in because of the multitude of fish.
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>John 21:6 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Jesus knew the outcome of obedience  
* He knew what **would** happen **if** intended action is performed
* Shows God’s wisdom in guiding decisions

---

## God has Perfect Knowledge

![](OmniPics/OwlBooksIdeas.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "Oh, the depth of the riches both of the  
    wisdom and knowledge of God!"  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em;">    <em>Romans 11:33 (NKJV)</em></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "Great is our Lord... His understanding  
    is infinite."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Psalm 147:5 (NKJV)</em></p>

* God’s knowledge is perfect and complete  
* No one can teach Him, there is nothing He still needs to learn  
* Understanding beyond measure  
* Unlike humans, His knowledge is eternal and unchanging

---

## Systematic Summary of Omniscience

![](OmniPics/OwlBooksIdeasThoughts.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Omniscience is one of the most discussed and fascinating attributes of God
* God knows all past, present, and future truths
  * What exactly does that mean?
  * How does God’s foreknowledge relate to human freedom?

---

## Omniscience Defined

![](OmniPics/brainPower.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Defined in terms of truth:  
  * God knows all true propositions and believes no falsehoods  
* For any true proposition, God knows it and does not believe its negation  
* For any true proposition `p`, God knows `p` and does not believe `not-p`  
* God knows only and all truths
* God foreknew the motion of every subatomic particle before creation  
* He knows our thoughts before we think them and our free choices before we make them  

---

## God Knows Could, Would and Will Futures

![](OmniPics/GodRoadFork.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* God knows actual and hypothetical truths
* God knows what we
  * **Could** do
    * All logically possible options
  * **Would** do
    * Free choices in different circumstances
  * **Will** do
    * Free choices in actually occurring circumstances

---

## Beyond Omniscience: Self-Knowledge

![](OmniPics/SelfKnowledge.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Propositional knowledge: People get hungry  
* Self-knowledge: I am hungry  
* Self-knowledge motivates action (e.g., eat chocolate)  
* Without self-knowledge, propositional knowledge alone is insufficient for action  

* God’s cognitive excellence exceeds omniscience  
  * Propositional knowledge + self-knowledge  
  * God knows, “I am the creator”, “I love my creation”

---

## Beyond Omniscience: Innate Knowledge

![](OmniPics/BrainInnate.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* God’s knowledge is innate, not acquired  
* He does not learn from others or external sources  
* This makes God’s intellectual excellence greater than any being who acquires knowledge  

---

## God’s Cognitive Excellence

![](OmniPics/BrainInnate.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* God’s intellectual excellence surpasses omniscience  
* He knows all truths, has perfect self-knowledge, and possesses innate knowledge  
* This should inspire praise, adoration, and wonder  

---

## Implications and Problems of Omniscience

![](OmniPics/OwlQuestions.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* God’s knowledge includes foreknowledge of free choices  
* Raises two key questions:  
  * Compatibility of foreknowledge and freedom  
  * The nature of divine foreknowledge and human free will  
* How can we be free if God infallibly foreknows our actions?
* How can God foreknow free actions?

---

## Compatibility of Foreknowledge and Freedom

![](OmniPics/ForeknowledgeAndFreedom.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* If God knows in advance every choice we will make, is everything fated to occur?
* Example:  
  * God foreknows Peter will deny Christ three times  
  * Does this mean Peter is fated to deny Christ?
* Does divine foreknowledge imply fatalism?

---

## Fatalism and Divine Foreknowledge

![](OmniPics/GodsToys.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Fatalism: Everything happens necessarily  
* Some theologians (Luther, Clavin) equate foreknowledge with foreordination:  
  * God foreordains everything, so He knows the future  
  * This view denies human freedom  
* Problems
  * Makes God the author of sin and have evil character
  * Makes us God's toys

---

## Foreknowledge ≠ Foreordination

![](OmniPics/ForeknowledgeForeordination.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* God knows in advance the choices people will freely make  
* Foreknowledge does not mean God determines those choices  
* The event determines what God foreknows, not vice versa  
* Example:  
  * Because we will freely choose to eat chocolate, God foreknows it

---

## Foreknowledge ≠ Foreordination ≠ Decree

![](OmniPics/StringsAndScroll.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **Foreknowledge**: God’s timeless knowledge of all events, including what every possible person **would** freely choose in any circumstance
* **Foreordination**: God’s sovereign act of determining the course of events, choosing which possibilities to actualize in the created world such that they aligning with His ultimate purposes
* **Decree**: The unchangeable plan resulting from God’s act of foreordination
* **Timeless Nature**: Foreknowledge, foreordination, and the decree exist timelessly in God’s eternal nature—there is no “before” or “after” in God’s perspective, only logical order

---

## Chronological vs. Logical Order

![](OmniPics/ChooseChocolate.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Chronological order: Foreknowledge comes before the event in time  
* Logical order: The event explains (is logically prior to) God’s foreknowledge
* Example:  
  * You choose chocolate → God foreknows it  
  * Not: God foreknows it → You choose chocolate

---

## Alternate Choices and Foreknowledge

![](OmniPics/AlternateChoices.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **If** the event were different, God’s foreknowledge **would** be different  
* Example:  
  * If you choose coconut instead, God foreknows that instead  
* God’s foreknowledge tracks your choices like an infallible barometer  

---

## Foreknowledge Does Not Imply Fatalism

![](OmniPics/EyeOverFork.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* God’s foreknowledge does not cause events to occur  
* Example:
  * Knowing the sun will rise is not causing it
  * Event E occurs freely or randomly  
    * God’s knowledge of E does not make it necessary  
* Fatalism imposes an unintelligible constraint on human freedom
  * *Caused by God* and *our free choice* cannot be both true

---

## Freedom and Foreknowledge

![](OmniPics/EyeOverFork.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Free choices are logically prior to God’s foreknowledge  
* God’s foreknowledge does not prejudice human freedom  
* When the time comes, you are free to act differently  

---

## Logical Order (Assuming Molinism)

![](OmniPics/Decree.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

1. **Middle Knowledge**: Free choices are the logical start. God foreknows how anyone would act in any hypothetically possible circumstance
2. **Infinite Possible Worlds**: God evaluates all possible worlds with all combinations of circumstances and associated free choices and subseqent outcomes
3. **Divine Forordination**: God chooses which circumstances to actualize, determining one world with His preferred cumstances and associated preferred foreknown free choices
4. **Decree**: The infinite hypotheticals collapse into one actualized reality through God’s decree, aligning with His purposes

---

## Key Takeaway: Foreknowledge and Freedom

![](OmniPics/Decree.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* God’s foreknowledge is infallible but does not constrain human freedom  
* Events are free and contingent, not fated or necessary  
* God’s knowledge tracks reality without determining it  

---

## How does God Know the Future?

![](OmniPics/GodBooksAndTime.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Middle knowledge addresses how God knows future events  
* Two models of divine cognition:  
  * Perceptualist model: God "sees" the future  
  * Conceptualist model: God’s knowledge is intrinsic and innate  

---

## Perceptualist Model of Divine Cognition

![](OmniPics/GodAndWorldDetails.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Perceptualist model: God "looks" and "sees" what is there  
* Assumes God "foresees" the future like sense perception  
* Problem: Future events do not yet exist, so there is nothing to perceive

---

## Conceptualist Model of Divine Cognition

![](OmniPics/GodBooksAndHearts.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* God’s knowledge is intrinsic, like a mind’s knowledge of innate ideas
* God knows all truths, including truths about future contingents
* God’s knowledge is not acquired but essential to His nature

---

## Middle Knowledge and What-If Truths

![](OmniPics/GodRoadFork.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Middle knowledge includes what-if truths:  
  * "**If** you were been in Peter’s place, you **would** deny Jesus"  
* Not foreknowledge, as the situation never occurs
* God knows what free creatures **would** do in any given circumstance

---

## A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens

![](OmniPics/GodRoadFork.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come shows Scrooge what **would** happen **if** he does not repent
* Not **will** happen. Not foreknowledge (it doesn’t happen)
* Not **could** happen. Not mere possibilities (e.g., Scrooge becoming a florist)
* Subjunctive conditional: What **would** happen **if** Scrooge does not repent

---

## Does God Have Middle Knowledge?

![](OmniPics/GodBooksAndTime.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Question: Does God know what creatures would freely do in any circumstance?  
* Proponents (e.g., Luis Molina) say yes
* Opponents (Luther, Calvin) say God only has simple foreknowledge of what will happen

---

## Theological Importance of Middle Knowledge

![](OmniPics/GodBooksAndHearts.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Middle knowledge reconciles divine sovereignty and human freedom
* God knows how free creatures would act in any circumstance
* Allows God to achieve His purposes without abridging human freedom

---

## Example: Divine Providence in Acts 4:27-28

![](OmniPics/GodAndWorldDetails.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    "For truly against Your holy Servant Jesus, whom You anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together to do whatever Your hand and Your purpose determined before to be done."  
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">    <em>Acts 4:27-28 (NKJV)</em></p>

* "Herod, Pontius Pilate, Gentiles, and Jews did whatever God’s plan predestined"  
* God’s providence includes human freedom and sinful actions  
* Middle knowledge enables God to achieve His ultimate purposes  

---

## Complexity of Middle Knowledge

![](OmniPics/GodOpenBooks.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Example: Success of traveling Back To The Future
  * Requires parents to meet and fall in love
  * Involves innumerable contingencies (dad overcoming fear, right opportunity, lightning at the right time, ...)
* Only an infinite mind could direct free creatures toward His ends

---

## Middle Knowledge and the Problem of Evil

![](OmniPics/GodBooksAndTime.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* God’s options may be limited by human freedom  
  * Possible worlds where everyone freely does the right thing may not be feasible  
  * God permits evil to achieve greater good and His ultimate purposes  

* God chooses a world with best ratio of good to evil  
  * Evil results from human free choices, not God’s will  
  * God’s ultimate purposes will be accomplished despite evil  

---

## Middle Knowledge: Key Takeaways

![](OmniPics/GodOpenBooks.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Middle knowledge reconciles divine sovereignty and human freedom  
* God knows what free creatures would do in any circumstance  
* God achieves His purposes without violating human freedom  
* Provides a robust framework for understanding divine providence  

---
