## Systematic Summary: Omnipotence

![](OmniPics/GodSpheresOfPower.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **Omnipotence**: God has unlimited power and can bring about any state of affairs logically possible for anyone in that situation  
  * **Power**: His degree of power is maximal, cannot be exceeded  
    * An omnipotent being finds all actions easy, regardless of difficulty  
  * **Range**: The range of logically possible actions  
    * Excludes logical impossibilities (e.g., creating a square circle)  
    * Such restrictions do not diminish omnipotence, as they are not due to a lack of power
  * Same range but weaker power is no longer omnipotent

---

## Paradoxes of Omnipotence: Acting Contrary to Nature

![](OmniPics/EscherStrairsImpossible.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Can God act against His own nature (e.g., sin or create another god and worship him)?  
* No, such actions are inconsistent with His essential properties  
* Omnipotence does not include violating His own nature  

---

## Can God Sin?

![](OmniPics/GodSin.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">

</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;"> <em>1 John 1:5 (NKJV)</em></p>

* God's omnipotence does not include the ability to sin  
* Sinning is contrary to His holy and loving nature  
* Scripture affirms God's perfect goodness:  
  * "God cannot be tempted by evil" (James 1:13)  
  * "Your eyes are too pure to look on evil" (Habakkuk 1:13)  
  * "The Lord is good" (Psalm 100:5)  
* God's inability to sin reflects His perfect nature, not a limitation  

---

## The Reality of Jesus' Temptation

![](OmniPics/JesusTemptation.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Jesus faced genuine temptation in His humanity (Matthew 4:1-11, Luke 4:1-13)
* Satan's temptations exploited His physical needs, e.g. hunger
  * Not morally wrong, but still contrary to God's planned provision
* Yet, Jesus relied on Scripture, resisted a suffering-free choice
  * But He experienced the real pull of Satan's offers

## Jesus and the Possibility of Sin

![](OmniPics/JesusSinLess.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin.

* Additional scriptures:  
  * "He committed no sin" (1 Peter 2:22)

* Jesus' sinlessness, rooted in His divine nature, makes Him the perfect substitute for us

---

## Paradoxes of Omnipotence: Logical Impossibilities

## Paradoxes of Omnipotence: Unactualizable Worlds

![](InfinityPics/PossibleWorlds.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Can God create any logically possible world (e.g., a sinless world with free creatures)?  
* Not necessarily, due to creaturely freedom and would-truths vs could-truths  
* Some worlds may be infeasible despite being logically possible
  * Sometimes people who **could** choose to do good **would** not do so

---

## Resolution of Paradoxes

![](OmniPics/EscherPortait.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Limitations on God's power are purely logical, not due to lack of power  
* Logic reflects God's nature; He cannot act inconsistently with Himself

## Practical Applications of Omnipotence

![](OmniPics/GodMeetsNeeds.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Understanding omnipotence is not just theoretical; it changes how we live  
* God’s power applies directly to our daily struggles and purpose  
* Three applications
  1. God's power works in us
  2. Nothing can defeat God's purposes
  3. God is adequate to meet all our needs

---

## Application 1: God's Power Works In Us

![](OmniPics/GodPowerInUs.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    For it is the God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us. We are hard-pressed on every side, yet not crushed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed—always carrying about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -2em; margin-bottom: -1em;"> <em>2 Corinthians 4:6-10 (NKJV)</em></p>

* The same power that created the universe is at work in us
* This power isn’t ours—it’s God’s, working through fragile humans
* God's power sustains us through affliction, persecution, and trials
* His life is manifested in our mortal bodies

---

## God's Power In Us (Ephesians 1:19-21)

![](OmniPics/GodTouchingMan.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    ...and what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power which He worked in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in that which is to come.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -2em; margin-bottom: -1em;"> <em>Ephesians 1:19-21 (NKJV)</em></p>

* The power that raised Jesus from the dead is at work in us.  
* This power is far above all rule, authority, and dominion.  

---

## God's Power Beyond Our Imagination (Ephesians 3:20-21)

![](OmniPics/GobPowerBeyond.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us, to Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -2em; margin-bottom: -1em;"> <em>Ephesians 3:20-21 (NKJV)</em></p>

* God's power exceeds our limited vision
* We must ask and think for greater things, trusting in His ability

---

## The Vine and the Branches (John 15:5)

![](OmniPics/Vine.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;"> <em>John 15:5 (NKJV)</em></p>

* Apart from Christ, we can do nothing of spiritual significance
* Abiding in Him is the key to bearing fruit
* Therefore:
  * Apart from Christ, we can do much less than we think
  * Through Christ, we can do much more than we think

---

## Strength Through Christ (Philippians 4:13)

![](OmniPics/StrengthThroughChrist.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;"> <em>Philippians 4:13 (NKJV)</em></p>

* His strength enables us to accomplish God's will
* Again:
  * Apart from Christ, we can do much less than we think
  * Through Christ, we can do much more than we think

---

## God's Power in Weakness (2 Corinthians 12:8-10)

![](OmniPics/ChickenPower.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    Concerning this thing I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might depart from me. And He said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -2em; margin-bottom: -1em;"> <em>2 Corinthians 12:8-10 (NKJV)</em></p>

* God's power is most evident in our weakness
* Paul rejoices in his weaknesses because they magnify God's strength
* God doesn’t just overcome our weakness—He shines through it  
* Our limitations become platforms for His strength  

---

## Example: Fred and Elaine

![](OmniPics/BibleStudy.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Fred was serving in church and his communite
* Fred’s stroke brought him to a nursing home  
* He and Elaine started a Bible study in the nursing home to encourage others in despair  
* God’s power turned their frailty into a means to reach the unreached

---

## Application 2: Nothing Can Defeat God's Purposes

![](OmniPics/Decree.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    In him, according to the purpose of him who accomplishes all things according to the counsel of his will...
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;"> <em>Ephesians 1:11 (NKJV)</em></p>

* God's purposes will always be accomplished
* No force — human, natural, or spiritual — can derail God’s plans  
* His omnipotence guarantees His purposes prevail  
* This gives us confidence in chaos and setbacks  

---

## Joseph: A Case Study in Providence

![](OmniPics/StringsAndScroll.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* Joseph's life illustrates God's providential purposes:  
  * Betrayed by his brothers
  * Falsely accused by Potiphar's wife
  * Imprisoned unjustly
* Yet, God used these events to save Joseph's family and fulfill His plan for Israel
* As we trust in him, walk with him, and rely upon his power, we can have confidence that God’s purposes for our lives will be accomplished

---

## God's Will May Include Failure

![](OmniPics/GodInGoodAndSuffering.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* God's will for our lives may include failure and suffering
* Failure teaches lessons that success cannot
* Examples:  
  * Persecution and martyrdom
  * Loss of jobs or positions
* But not all failure is a lesson from God
  * Consequence of the fall (sickness)
  * Free will (evil deeds of others)
* Either way, there is no guarantee for success in this life

---

## The Health and Wealth Gospel Lie

![](OmniPics/JesusFerrari.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* The "health and wealth gospel" falsely promises worldly success for believers
* True biblical teaching acknowledges that God's will may include suffering and hardship
* God's purposes are spiritual, not necessarily material
  * Some examples of material blessings do not make it a rule

---

## Application 3: God Is Adequate to All Our Needs

![](OmniPics/GodAndPrayer.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* God's omnipotence means He is sufficient for every need:  
  * No prayer is too hard
  * No need is too great
  * No temptation is too strong
  * No misery is too deep

---

## Trusting and Worshiping God's Omnipotence

![](OmniPics/GodTrust.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

* **Trusting God's Omnipotence**:  
  * Even in failure and suffering, His will prevails
  * He works all things for the good of those who love Him (Romans 8:28).  

* **Worshiping an Omnipotent God**:  
  * God's omnipotence inspires worship and awe.  
  * We glorify Him for His unmatched power and sovereignty.  
  * To Him be glory forever and ever (Ephesians 3:21).  

---

## Closing: Power for Today, Hope for Tomorrow

![](OmniPics/LookingUpInWorship.jpg style="float: right; width: 9rem")

<p style="font-family: 'Gabriola', serif;">
    Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us, to Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;"> <em>Ephesians 3:20-21 (NKJV)</em></p>

* God’s omnipotence empowers us, secures His plans, and meets our needs  
* Live boldly, trust fully, pray confidently
