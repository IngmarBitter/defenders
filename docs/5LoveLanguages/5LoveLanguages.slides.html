* Is NOT materialism, the cost of the gift is not the focus 
* The receiver of gifts thrives on the love, thoughtfulness, and effort behind the gift
* The perfect gift or gesture shows that you are known, you are cared for, and you are prized above whatever was sacrificed to bring the gift to you
* A missed birthday, anniversary, or a hasty, thoughtless gift would be disastrous – so would the absence of everyday gestures
* Gifts are visual representations of love and are treasured greatly.
* The gift cost is an investment into the relationship
