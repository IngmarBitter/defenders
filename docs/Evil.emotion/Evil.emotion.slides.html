## Why?

![](woman.crying.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

God sometimes ...

* let Satan inflict suffering to proove a point 
  - Job
  
* struck people dead immediately after sinning 
  - Ananias & Sapphira, Acts 5:1-11
  
* ... or after many generations of sinning 
  - Sodom & Gomorrah, Genesis
  
* inflicted disease as punisment for the Philistines capturing the ark of God 
  - 1 Samuel 5

## Why Me?

!!!
   But you, O Lord, are a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness.
   Psalm 86:15

![](woman.crying.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

* God punishing sin quickly is the exception, not the rule
* God typically is not the reason for pain and suffering even if we deserve it
* God typically does not give an explanation why it did happen

## Jesus comforted and healed

![](jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

* Had dinner at the home of rejected men 
* Weaped with the mother loosing her child Lazarus
* Healed the sick 
* Sacrificed for the ones he loved

## Jesus told us

![](jesus.dove.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

* He sent us the Holy Spirit
  - to comfort and guide us
  - to give us strength

* He commanded us to be his hands and feet
  - to be the ones that comfort others
  - ... the ones that heal and give strength

## Suffering prepares us

![](bootcamp.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

When we suffer the best help is ...

* from people that have made it through the same suffering
  + that have learned to overcome or cope with it
  + that can tell from experience that there is hope

Suffering gets us ready to =>

* help others in the future
* become Jesus hands and feet
* act upon Jesus's behalf
