## The Meaning of Baptism

![](BaptismMeaning.jpg style="float: right; width: 11rem")

Baptism is the full submersion in water of a new believer in Christ, accompanied by the declaration that the individual is baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
!!!
    Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit

    - Mat 28:19 MEV

As new believers, we commit to making Jesus our Lord and being obedient to His commands. Baptism signifies the completion of the process of coming to saving faith. When we undergo baptism, it demonstrates that our commitment has matured from the intellectual realm to practical action, guiding our behavior. It is during the act of baptism that God provides the gift of salvation. Through this act, the new believer reaches a level of gospel understanding and trust in Christ that makes Jesus’s sacrificial death effective in atoning for their sin guilt. Thus, baptism becomes the occasion through which salvation is gifted by the means of Jesus’s atoning death.

In addition, full immersion in water symbolizes and connects us with Christ's death, burial, resurrection and their atoning benefits for us:

* Going into the water the believer remembers the old guilty self that justly deserved death and the pain and suffering of Christ as our representative and substitute on the cross.

* Under the water the believer associates Christ's death with his own dying to sin and his own death penalty being paid and being cleared of all guilt before God. This is the moment God chooses to apply the atonement of Jesus' sacrificial death to us.

* Emerging from the water symbolizes Christ's resurrection to new life and the believer associates it with his own spiritual new life in Christ as regenerated, redeemed, forgiven, loved, and adopted child of God.

!!!
    Do you not know that we who were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into His death?   ​Therefore we were buried with Him by baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.
    - Rom 6:3-4 MEV

!!!
    And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He has resurrected together with Him, having forgiven you all sins.
    - Col 2:12 MEV

### Baptism by Full Immersion

![](BaptismFullImmersion.jpg style="float: right; width: 11rem")

There are several compelling reasons to practice baptism by full immersion:

**Meaning of the Greek Word:** The New Testament term "βαπτίζω" (baptizo) means "to immerse," "to submerge," or "to dip."  It was used in various contexts, such as the sinking of a ship, the dyeing of a garment (where the cloth is completely dipped into dye), or the drawing of water by dipping a vessel. All of those result in the object of baptizo being fully submerged.

**Symbolism Alignment:** The symbolism of being buried with Christ (Romans 6:3) resonates most meaningfully when the believer is fully submerged.

**Jesus' Example:** Jesus Himself was baptized by full immersion in the Jordan River.

!!!
    9 In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.   10 ​Coming up out of the water, He immediately saw the heavens opened and the Spirit descending on Him like a dove.
    - Mark 1:9-10 MEV

**New Testament Practice**: Other New Testament accounts of Baptisms were rivers when a carafe of water was closer and easier to use, but nonetheless the baptism was in a river, suggesting that it was by full immersion.

!!!
    The whole region of Judea and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him [John the Baptist] and were all baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
    
    - Mark 1:5

!!!
    John also was baptizing in Aenon toward Salim, because much water was there. And people came and were baptized.

    - John 3:23

!!!
    36 ​As they went on their way, they came to some water. And the eunuch said, “Look, here is water. What hinders me from being baptized?”   ​37 Philip said, “If you believe with all your heart, you may.” He answered, “I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.”   38 ​And he commanded the chariot to halt. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and he baptized him.

    - Acts 8:36-38

**Humbling submission:** Baptism as an act of humble submission to God is more profound when it involves full immersion.

**Personal Experience:** For many believers, full immersion provides a more impactful and tangible experience, symbolizing a deep spiritual transformation.

## The Significance of Baptism for Believers

![](BaptismSiginificance.jpg style="float: right; width: 11rem")

Baptism is a commanded practice for Christians, as explicitly stated in Matthew 28:19. There is no biblical directive to delay or avoid baptism. Hence, it is universally commanded for Christians and often a prerequisite for church membership.

!!!
    Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
    - Mat 28:19 MEV

The act of submitting to Baptism demonstrates publicly to witnesses, but more importantly to the new believer himself, that the mental commitment to Christ as Lord and Savior is now paired with acting out of this new faith in living in obedience to Christ's commands.

In addition, for Jewish converts, Baptism into Christ carried significant social consequences, as it could result in expulsion from the Jewish temple and the religious community. Similar consequences still result in many non-Western cultures today - in Islam, the consequence is the death penalty.

## Baptism At the Time of Committing to Christ

![](BaptismTiming.jpg style="float: right; width: 11rem")

Baptism should be administered at the time an individual commits to Christ. It is a significant and memorable way to publicly mark that one's faith has developed enough to be put into practice, starting a lifelong journey to follow Jesus.

Several New Testament examples illustrate the practice of baptizing new believers immediately after they commit to Christ:

**The Day of Pentecost (Acts 2:41):** About three thousand people believed and were baptized following Peter's sermon.

!!!
    Then those who gladly received his word were baptized, and that day about three thousand souls were added to them.

    - Acts 2:41 MEV

**The Ethiopian Eunuch (Acts 8:36-38):** Philip shared the gospel with an Ethiopian eunuch. Upon understanding and accepting the message, the eunuch requested to be baptized. Philip confirmed the sincerity of his belief and then baptized him.

!!!
    ​As they went on their way, they came to some water. And the eunuch said, “Look, here is water. What hinders me from being baptized?”   ​Philip said, “If you believe with all your heart, you may.” He answered, “I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.”   ​And he commanded the chariot to halt. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and he baptized him.

    -Acts 8:36-38 MEV

**The Conversion of Saul/Paul (Acts 9:1-18):** Saul, later known as Paul, experienced a dramatic conversion on the road to Damascus. After being blinded he trusted and followed Jesus's command and then was visited by Ananias, who laid hands on him, Saul regained his sight and was baptized immediately after.

!!!
    Immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he could see again. And he rose up and was baptized.

    - Acts 9:18 MEV

**Cornelius and His Household (Acts 10:44-48):** Cornelius, a Roman centurion, and his household heard the gospel preached by Peter. They received the Holy Spirit, and Peter commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.

!!!
    47 “Can anyone forbid water for baptizing these, who have received the Holy Spirit as we have?”   48 ​So he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. [...]

    - Acts 10:47-48 MEV

**Lydia and Her Household (Acts 16:14-15):** Lydia, a seller of purple cloth in Philippi, heard Paul’s message, believed and was baptized along with her household.

!!!
    14 ​A woman named Lydia, a seller of purple fabric of the city of Thyatira, who worshipped God, heard us. The Lord opened her heart to acknowledge what Paul said.   15 ​When she and her household were baptized, she entreated us, saying, “If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and remain there.” And she persuaded us.

    - Acts 16:14-15 MEV

**The Philippian Jailer and His Family (Acts 16:30-33):** After an earthquake freed Paul and Silas from prison, the Philippian jailer asked them what he must do to be saved. They shared the gospel with him, and he and all his family were baptized.

!!!
    30 He then led them out and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”   ​31 They said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you and your household will be saved.”   32 ​And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his household.   33 ​In that hour of the night he took them and washed their wounds. And immediately he and his entire household were baptized.
    
    - Acts 16:30-33 MEV

## Delayed / Missed Baptism

What if someone heard the gospel preached, centered on our sinfulness, need for repentance and Jesus being our substitute and representative in His death, burial and resurrection through which we are granted salvation - but without emphasis on the need to be baptized? What is the state of such a person after his firm decision to commit his life to Jesus and to accept Him as Lord and Savior?  Two famous examples of this are Billy Graham and C.S.Lewis. Graham was a believer for about a month before he was baptized by full immersion, and Lewis was never baptized after coming to faith. In both cases, the preacher and the new convert were sincere and willing to trust and follow Jesus but did not understand the importance of Baptism as explained in this document up to here.

There seem to be at least four possible views on the state of those believers:

* **#1 Not saved:** In the most strict view, baptism is a hard requirement for salvation and thus Lewis was never a Christian and Graham became a Christian only at his baptism, a month after he thought he had become a Christian. This view would have to argue that John 3:16 is not a good verse to use in evangelism as it misleads us into believing that believing in Christ without baptism is sufficient for salvation.

* **#2 Only God knows:** In the given context baptism is missing. Since there is no explicit teaching in the Bible about what happens in this case, this view leaves the determination of the state of the salvation of those individuals to God. God has the authority and ability to apply Jesus's sacrifice to these believers as He sees fit. But He is not obligated to reveal or explain to us what he does.
  
* **#3 Exception from the norm:** This view, referred to below as *baptism completes faith*, emphasizes that we should teach baptism as an important part of the conversion process, as it gives both, God and ourselves the assurance that our faith is sufficiently committed to result in influencing our actions.  For any typical conversion experience, committing to Christ will occur with the expectation that this step is completed through baptism and thus the time of regeneration is during the baptism.  This view acknowledges that God can choose to apply Jesus' atoning death to anyone else who is insufficiently informed about these biblical teachings.  Obvious examples are the Old Testament believers and the thief on the cross next to Jesus.  Similarly, God would save contemporary believers who followed incomplete gospel teachings in the same way.  This is further supported in the Book of Romans where it states that where there is no law there is no condemnation, meaning that God will not hold us accountable for requirements that we did not know and are not made clear by Him in other ways. Consequently, Graham and Lewis would both have become Christians at the time of their repentance and a firm commitment to trusting Jesus as Lord and Savior.

* **#4 Baptism is a consequence of salvation:** In this view, baptism is not required for salvation and regeneration. This legal state transition is achieved as an act of God at the time of repentance and a firm commitment to trusting Jesus as Lord and Savior. It is taught and expected that subsequently the new believer will put his faith into action and follow Jesus' commands. And clearly, the first step that is commanded is to be baptized. The only consistent response is for the believer to follow through with baptism as soon as possible.  Considering James 2:24, which teaches that faith without works is dead, this view would see the refusal to get baptized as an indicator that the believer is not actually committed to following Christ and his teachings and thus would call into question if he was saved at all. Consequently, in Graham's case, this view would hold that he was saved at commitment and that his baptism confirmed that his faith was sincere and translated into action. In the case of Lewis, he was saved also at the time of commitment, and his failing to be baptized would be seen as an incomplete Bible understanding. However, Lewis's other speeches and writings are evidence that his faith was sincere and resulted in plenty of other actions, so it cannot be claimed that his faith was dead and that he was not saved.

So which one is correct?  Note that under all four views, we have an agreement that *belief + baptism = salvation*.  

Contrast this with the great commission that commands us to 1) make disciples, 2) baptize them and 3) teach them to obey Jesus's commands. That leads to the formula of *belief + baptism + good works = salvation*.  Both formulas are correct in the sense that a person with all those traits is saved. The parts of the formula are typically steps along a timeline - after belief and baptism, it is expected that good works will follow. And with the first two already resulting in salvation, the person remains saved when good works are added. Consequently, we need to distinguish between necessary prerequisites and consequences. The good works are a consequence, so when a person is indeed saved, we expect them to show good works. Hence, good works and salvation are correlated, but the good works are not the cause of salvation. See also section *1.7.2 Emphasis on Faith*,*, which makes it even clearer that good works are not a requirement for salvation.

With this analysis in mind, what about the *+ baptism* in the formula? Is that also an expected consequence of salvation, or is it on the necessary requirements side, or is there a third option? The four views here answer respectively with #1 necessary, #2 we don't know, #3 third option, and #4 consequence.  

Referring again to section *1.7.2 Emphasis on Faith*, it becomes clear that it cannot be #1 necessary. 

#2 We don't know is a practical answer, but not very satisfying - especially as it leaves unresolved the state of Old Testament saints and many famous contemporary people identifying as Christian. 

#4 Does resonate with section *1.7.2 Em_Emphasis on Faith* but is less obvious match with *1.7.1 Emphasis on Baptism*.  

The winner is *#3 exception from the norm*, where the norm is *baptism-completes-faith*, which distinguishes between a) and b). a) The normal conversion timeline found it Acts, where coming to saving faith is reached during the baptism such that it is both true: salvation is by faith alone and salvation is granted during the baptism. And b) the exception from the norm, where saving faith is reached without baptism. In this case, when the believer learns that he is commanded to be baptized he should do so as soon as possible. If he never learns about this command, then God will not hold him accountable for following it. Thus, the Old Testament saints and contemporary Christians such as Billy Graham and C.S. Lewis were saved under this part b) option, but what we should preach and teach to any individual seeking Christ is option a).

## Considering Rebaptism

![](BaptismRepeated.jpg style="float: right; width: 11rem")

Rebaptism may be considered for those uncertain about their initial baptism due to lack of memory, coercion, or a previous lack of genuine faith. However, rebaptism is not necessary for those who have sinned post-baptism but rather, repentance and seeking forgiveness are advised (Acts 8:14-24).

!!!
    14 Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that **Samaria had received the word of God**, they sent Peter and John to them.   15 ​When they came down, they prayed for them that they **might receive the Holy Spirit**,   ​16 **for still He had come on none of them. They were only baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus**.   17 ​Then **they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit**.
    
    18 ​When Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,   ​saying, “Give me also this power, that whomever I lay hands on may receive the Holy Spirit.”
    
    20 ​Peter said to him, “May your money perish with you because you thought you could purchase the gift of God with money!   21 ​You have neither part nor share in this matter, for your heart is not right before God.   22 ​Therefore repent of your wickedness, and ask God if perhaps the intention of your heart may be forgiven you.   ​23 For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.”
    
    24 ​Then Simon answered, “Pray to the Lord for me that nothing you have spoken may come upon me.”

    - Acts 8:14-24 MEV

## Baptism as a Unifying Force Among Believers

![](BaptismUnifying.jpg style="float: right; width: 11rem")

Emphasizing unity in the Christian faith, baptism is a shared experience among believers (Ephesians 4:5). We advocate for unity and understanding in baptismal practices, underlining the importance of God's truth and the unity it brings (John 17:20-23).

Baptism acts as a unifying experience among Christians, as emphasized in Ephesians 4:5. It fosters unity and understanding in baptismal practices, underscoring the significance of God's truth and the unity it imparts among believers (John 17:20-23).

!!!
    2 ​With all humility, meekness, and patience, bearing with one another in love,   ​3 be eager to **keep the unity** of the Spirit in **the bond of peace**.   4 ​There is one body and one Spirit, even as you were called in one hope of your calling,   5 ​one Lord, one faith, **one baptism**,   6 ​one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.

    - Ephesians 4:2-6 MEV

!!!
    20 ​“I do not pray for these alone, but also for those who will believe in Me through their word,   21 ​that **they may all be one**, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You. May **they also be one in Us**, that the world may believe that You have sent Me.   22 ​I have given them the glory which You gave Me, that **they may be one** even as We are one:   23 ​I in them and You in Me, that **they may be perfect in unity**, and that the world may know that You have sent Me, and have loved them as You have loved Me.

    - John 17:20-23 MEV

## Baptism, Works and Salvation

![](BaptismWorksSalvation.jpg style="float: right; width: 11rem")

Baptism holds great significance for followers of Christ in any denomination.  A key question is whether it is necessary/essential for salvation. While some passages in the Bible, such as Acts 2:38, are sometimes interpreted as baptism is necessary for the forgiveness of sins, receiving the Holy Spirit, and salvation, other passages emphasize that salvation is by faith-alone. This apparent contradiction poses a challenge in understanding the role of baptism in the salvation process.

**baptism-completes-faith:** To reconcile this tension, we view baptism as a first step of obedience that is part of the salvation process, but not a work that merits salvation. This acknowledges that salvation is ultimately a gift from God, made possible only through Jesus' sacrifice on the cross. Baptism, then, becomes the **occasion** at which **the means of salvation** (Jesus' atoning death) is applied to the believer's life. It is not the act of baptism itself that saves, but rather the faith in Jesus that it represents. Baptism completes the process of coming to faith - of repentance, trusting Christ, and committing to follow Him. This understanding allows for a more consistent interpretation of the various scriptures that emphasize both the importance of baptism and the necessity of faith for salvation.

There are two other views that swing the pendulum too far in only one direction:

**faith-alone:** This view emphasizes that Jesus' sacrifice alone is the means of salvation and that there is no physical act of man needed to complete Jesus' work. It sees baptism as a work and thus rejects it as a requirement for salvation. However, it does not see the act of repentance and trusting in Christ as a work. This is an arbitrary classification of works. It is not clear at all that making a commitment is less of a work than having someone else submerse you in water.  Most importantly though, it makes Baptism a much less important step that often becomes optional or at least delayed much more than in any of the examples given in Acts.

**Baptism completes Jesus' work:** This view sees baptism as necessary for salvation and sees it as a work that is needed to complete what Jesus has started. Often this is paired with keeping up the good works of keeping the commandments every day to remain in a state of meriting salvation. This view is very legalistic and does not resonate well with the passages below. We will ignore it in the subsequent comments.

Here are some key Bible passages that address baptism, works, and salvation:

### Emphasis on Baptism

#### [Acts 2:38](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2%3A37-40&version=MEV): Repent and be baptized for the forgiveness of sin

!!!
    37 When they heard this, **they were stung in the heart** and said to Peter and to the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, **what shall we do?**”

    38 Peter said to them, “**Repent and be baptized**, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for **the forgiveness of sins**, and you shall **receive the gift of the Holy Spirit**.   39 [...]

    40 **With many other words** he testified and exhorted them, saying, “Be saved from this perverse generation.”

    - Acts 2:37-38,40 MEV

This verse, when understood in its full context, suggests that Peter's exhortation to "repent and be baptized" was a condensed version of a broader message that included belief in Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection. This combined package of belief, repentance, and baptism is what results in the forgiveness of sins and the receiving of the Holy Spirit - at the time of the baptism.

Nonetheless, if we paraphrase this verse at a baptism to become

* *"I baptize you in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; for the forgiveness of sins and to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit"*
 
then we shift the apparent meaning such that it sounds like baptism becomes the means of salvation. We should choose a phrase that does not run that risk of misunderstanding. Two options are:

* *"I baptize you in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit"* or
* *"Based on your confession, repentance from your sins, and commitment to follow Jesus, I baptize you in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; completing your faith for the forgiveness of sins and to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit"*

#### [Mark 16:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark+16%3A16&version=MEV) 

!!!
    “He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned”.

    - Mark 16:16

This verse clearly states that the combination of belief and baptism leads to salvation. The second half of the verse is equally clear that without faith man is condemned. Both are consistent with our view that baptism-completes-faith.

What is not clear is the state of those who believe but are not baptized.

* The *faith-alone* view, based on other verses, sees those as saved as well.

* The *baptism-completes-faith* view sees those as the exception. Anyone who truly believes will want to be baptized right away and deepen his faith through the process of baptism. So there is only a very brief window of being fully committed to Christ and not yet being baptized. God will accept people who die in that state into heaven based on their belief. Nonetheless, this exception does not eliminate the rule/command to be baptized at the time of trusting Jesus, nor does it diminish the effect of the baptism deepening the trust and commitment.

#### [1 Peter 3:21](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1 Pet 3.21)

!!!
    Figuratively this is like **baptism, which also saves us** now. It is not washing off the dirt from the body, but a response to God **from a good conscience through the resurrection of Jesus Christ**,

    - 1 Peter 3:21 MEV

Here the second part of the verse is to clarify the meaning of the first, namely that the significance of the baptism is not the "washing of the dirt" (the physical action of baptism) but "a response to God from a good conscience", meaning the conscience is already good before the baptisms starts.

* *faith-alone* sees this to imply that it must be after one's sins are forgiven and salvation has been received. Thus baptism cannot be a prerequisite for salvation. See [gotquestions.org/baptism-1Peter-3-21](https://www.gotquestions.org/baptism-1Peter-3-21.html)

* *baptism-completes-faith* sees the good conscience as being completed/cleansed during the baptism.

An analogy might be that *faith-alone* sees passing the driver's license test as "getting your license" while *baptism-completes-faith* sees it as being handed your driver's license card. The qualification and the receiving of the actual card are part of the process for both, but the emphasis and significance are different.

#### [Acts 22:16](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Acts 22.16)

!!!
    "And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized, and wash your sins away, calling on his name."

    - Acts 22:16

* *baptism-completes-faith:* here we have trusting Jesus, baptism and forgiveness of sins combined, just as it fits with a new believer that at the time of trusting Jesus is being baptized and saved.

* *faith-alone:* This verse does not say that being baptized is what washes the sins away. It states two different commands: 1) baptism, 2) washing one's sins, to be done through "calling on His name" which means by believing in Christ. See [gotquestions.org/baptism-Acts-22-16](https://www.gotquestions.org/baptism-Acts-22-16.html)

#### [Galatians 3:27](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gal 3.27)

!!!
    “For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.”

    - Galatians 3:27

* *baptism-completes-faith:* baptism is equated with being clothed with Christ. Fits naturally with this view.

* *faith-alone:* Baptism here can be seen as baptism by the Holy Spirit, not by water. Thus it does not teach that baptism by water is a requirement for salvation.
Alternatively, if baptism is understood as a believer's water baptism, then everyone that was baptized also believed. And as such it is true that they were saved, or as stated here, "clothed with Christ". However, not based on the baptism, but based on the underlying prior belief. See [gotquestions.org/baptism-Galatians-3-27](https://www.gotquestions.org/baptism-Galatians-3-27.html)

#### Summary

These verses have reasonable interpretations in both views, but clearly, the *baptism-completes-faith* view is a more natural fit than the *faith-alone* view.

### Emphasis on Faith

These verses show that salvation was granted independently of baptism.

#### Acts 10:44-48: Holy Spirit before baptism

In Acts 10:1-33 Cornelius is described as gentile that is very eager to hear the gospel. And in 34-43 Peter preaches the gospel. Then comes 44ff:

!!!
    44  While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word.   45  All the believers of the circumcision who had come with Peter were astonished because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles.   46  For they heard them speaking in other tongues and magnifying God. Then Peter continued,   47  “Can anyone forbid water for baptizing these, who have received the Holy Spirit as we have?”   48  So he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they asked him to stay a few days.

Here we have 1) hearing and believing the gospel, 2) being filled with the Holy Spirit, and 3) being baptized.

* *faith-alone:* sees this as a straightforward example of being saved at step 1), salvation evidenced at step 2), and step 3) being a step after salvation was completed and thus not a necessary part of the salvation process.

* *baptism-completes-faith* sees this as an exception the rule that nonetheless is not deviating much. The receiving of the Holy Spirit was within minutes of being baptized.  And both, the established believers and the new gentile believers saw the baptism as the culmination of the coming-to-faith process.  Peter did not say "Since you are already filled with the Holy Spirit you can skip the baptism", instead he ordered the baptisms as soon as possible.

#### John 3:16 Belief leads to eternal life

!!!
    “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.

    - John 3:16

* *faith-alone:* This states the conditions for salvation. If water baptism was one of them it should be mentioned, but is not.
* *baptism-completes-faith* sees the baptism requirement as instituted by Jesus at the great commission, which was given after John 3:16.

#### 1 Corinthians 15:1-8

!!!
    1  Now, brothers, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which you have received, and in which you stand.   2  Through it you are saved, if you keep in memory what I preached to you unless you have believed in vain.  3  For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: how Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,   4  was buried, rose again the third day according to the Scriptures,   5  and was seen by Cephas, and then by the twelve.   6  Then He was seen by over five hundred brothers at once, of whom the greater part remain to this present time, though some have passed away.   7  Then He was seen by James and then by all the apostles.   8  Last of all, He was seen by me also, as by one born at the wrong time.

* *faith-alone:* This is one of the most clear statements of the conditions for salvation. If water baptism was one of them it should be mentioned, but is not.
* *baptism-completes-faith:* If Paul was trying to state just the conditions for salvation, then he should not have included in the same sentence the various post-resurrection appearances, which are not essential to salvation. Instead, Paul gives a listing of shared Christian core beliefs that Paul assumed everyone knew to emphasize that he's not telling them new stuff, only already established truths. And with that context, it does not matter that he left out repentance and left out baptism - it's simply not a text focussed on requirements for salvation.

#### 1 Corinthians 1:14,17: Paul on baptism

!!!
    14 I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius, 15 [...] 16 [...]

    17 For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to evangelize [...]

    - 1 Corinthians 1:14,17

In this passage, Paul is arguing against the divisions that plagued the Corinthian church.

* *faith-alone:* If baptism was necessary for salvation, why did Paul say he was thankful he baptized so few people? Why did he say that he was *not* sent to baptize? If baptism was necessary for salvation, Paul essentially said, “I am thankful I saved so few ...” and “For Christ did not send me to save ...”. That would be an unbelievably ridiculous statement for Paul to make. (See https://www.gotquestions.org/baptism-salvation.html )

* *baptism-completes-faith:* One verse earlier Paul asks rhetorically if they were baptized in the name of Paul. That implies that he knew they were all baptized in the name of Jesus, meaning they were all baptized. He did not conduct the baptisms, but he's not saying that baptism is not needed. It seems that when he was with that church there were some faithful leaders that he was comfortable leaving the baptisms to, so he could focus on the more difficult task of evangelizing and teaching.

#### Ephesians 2:8-9

!!!
    8  For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not of yourselves. It is the gift of God,   9  not of works, so that no one should boast.   10  For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we should walk in them.

This teaches that salvation is by faith alone.

* *faith-alone:* Adding any works, incl. water baptism, would make it no longer faith-alone. Thus water baptism is not a requirement.

* *baptism-completes-faith:* even faith-alone teaches that salvation is not unilaterally forced upon by God, but requires a to-do list for the believer: mental comprehension of the gospel, belief that it's true, repentance, trusting Jesus, committing to follow Him, accepting the gift of salvation. Those are not trivial but are still classified as not-works. This view simply includes baptism into that do-do list and also classifies it as not-works. And all of those items are things that either exalt Jesus or humble ourselves. Not things that can be used to boast about ourselves. And that's the main concern of this verse: we ought to not think we earned our salvation or did something that makes us deserve it and that consequently we could boast about.

### Titus 3:5

!!!
    5  not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of rebirth and the renewal of the Holy Spirit,

This teaches that salvation is not by works, but an undeserved gift from God.

* *faith-alone:* Adding any works, incl. water baptism, would make it no longer faith-alone. Thus water baptism is not a requirement.

* *baptism-completes-faith:* same as the prior passage, baptism is humbling and not something to boast about. Hence it can be considered not-works like the other things that *faith-alone* requires for salvation.

### Conclusion: Not essential but a very important command

The analysis shows that while baptism is not a necessary/essential means for salvation - reserved solely for faith in Jesus' sacrificial and atoning death - it is typically the occasion that completes the process of coming to faith, culminating in the gift of salvation and the filling with the Holy Spirit.
