## The Problem of Evil: Two Versions

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Intellectual problem
  - Logical version
  - Evidential (probabilistic) version
- Emotional problem
  - How we feel vs. what follows logically

---

## Keep Them Distinct

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Intellectual: philosophical analysis
- Emotional: pastoral care and comfort
- Good intellectual answers can sound cold to the suffering
- Pastoral responses can feel shallow in abstract debate

---

## Burden of Proof

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- We’re assessing arguments for atheism
- Atheist bears the burden to show:
  - Logical impossibility, or
  - Improbability of God given suffering
- Don’t let the burden shift to the theist by default

---

## Clarify Which Version

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Ask directly:
  - “Impossible” that God and suffering co-exist?
  - Or “improbable” that God exists given suffering?
- Tailor response to the stated version

---

## Logical Version: Claim

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- God is all-loving and all-powerful
- Suffering exists
- Therefore: alleged logical inconsistency

---

## Two Core Propositions

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

1. An all-loving, all-powerful God exists
2. Suffering exists
- No explicit contradiction
- Hidden assumptions must be added

---

## Hidden Assumptions Proposed

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

3. Necessarily, an all-powerful God can create any world He wants
4. Necessarily, an all-loving God prefers a world without suffering

---

## Assessing Assumption (3)

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Omnipotence does not include logical impossibilities
- Freedom of the will matters:
  - It’s incoherent to “make” free choices occur
  - Some worlds are not “creatable” if agents wouldn’t freely cooperate

---

## Free Will and Creational Limits

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- If free agents exist:
  - God cannot guarantee specific free outcomes
- Thus (3) is not necessarily true
- Logical version falters here

---

## Assessing Assumption (4)

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- All-loving God may allow suffering for greater goods
- Common-sense analogies (e.g., dentist, discipline)
- With genuine freedom, some goods require risk of suffering

---

## Virtue Requires Freedom

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Moral growth/virtue require free cooperation
- A world with some suffering may be better overall
- Thus (4) is not necessarily true

---

## A Plausible Consistency Statement

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

5. God could not have created a world with as much good as the actual world but with less suffering, and God has good reasons for permitting the suffering that exists.

- If possibly true, no inconsistency follows

---

## Logical Version: Status

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Heavy burden on atheist: show impossibility
- Contemporary consensus:
  - Logical version widely judged unsuccessful

---

## Evidential Version: Claim

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Concedes co-existence is possible
- Says: Given suffering, God’s existence is improbable
- Looks at apparent “pointless” suffering

---

## Response 1: Our Cognitive Limits

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- We’re finite in time, space, knowledge
- God’s providence spans the whole of history
- Reasons may be beyond our horizon

---

## Illustration: Chaos Sensitivity

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Small changes can lead to massive outcomes
- “Butterfly effect” in complex systems
- Tracing long-range consequences is intractable

---

## Illustration: Sliding Doors

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Seemingly trivial events radically alter life courses
- Our perspective can’t foresee ripples through history
- Appearance ≠ reality with respect to purpose

---

## Utilitarianism Analogy

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Major critique: outcome prediction limits
- Short-term bad may yield long-term good (and vice versa)
- Probability judgments exceed our competence

---

## Therefore on Response 1

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- We’re not in a good position to infer:
  - “Looks pointless” → “Is pointless”
- Evidential force diminishes

---

## Response 2: Probabilities Are Relative

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Always relative to background information
- Not interesting: P(God | suffering alone)
- Relevant: P(God | full scope of evidence)

---

## Full Scope Outweighs

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Any improbability from evil can be offset
- Cumulative case theism raises P(God)
- Consider the moral argument

---

## The Moral Argument from Evil

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

1. If God does not exist, objective moral values do not exist
2. Evil exists
3. Therefore objective moral values exist
4. Therefore God exists

- Paradox: Evil presupposes an objective moral standard

---

## Response 3: Christian Doctrines

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Certain Christian tenets increase co-existence probability:
  1) Life’s chief end is knowledge of God, not earthly comfort
  2) Human rebellion; God “gives them up”
  3) Eternal life reframes earthly suffering
  4) Knowing God is an incommensurable good

---

## Doctrine 1: Life’s Chief End

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Not pets and comfort; relational knowledge of God
- Suffering can deepen trust and dependence
- Growth may occur in sufferers and observers

---

## Empirical Corroboration: Growth Amid Suffering

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Church growth in suffering contexts:
  - Purification, resilience, reliance on God
- Historical patterns align with this doctrine

---

## Case: China

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Severe persecution (Cultural Revolution)
- Massive church growth post-1977
- Suffering correlated with spiritual awakening

---

## Case: El Salvador

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- War, poverty, calamity
- Significant evangelical growth over decades
- Harvest in the midst of hardship

---

## Case: Ethiopia (and beyond)

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Repression, famine, war; refined the church
- Millions coming to Christ
- Similar reports (e.g., Haiti post-earthquake)

---

## Global Trend Snapshot

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Ratio of evangelicals to non-believers shrinking historically
- Unprecedented in-gathering globally
- Suffering may contribute to openness

---

## Doctrine 2: Human Rebellion

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Moral evils unsurprising on Christian view
- Romans 1: God “gave them up”
- God permits human depravity to run its course

---

## Doctrine 3: Eternal Perspective

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- This life: foyer to eternity
- Paul’s “slight momentary afflictions” (2 Cor 4)
- Infinite future overwhelms finite present suffering

---

## Doctrine 4: Incommensurable Good

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Knowing God outweighs any temporal suffering
- Scale metaphor: “weight of glory” beyond comparison
- Grounds to say “God is good” even amid pain

---

## Burden of Proof (Revisited)

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Atheist must address the Christian God
- Show doctrines are probably false, or
- Show evil still renders God improbable given these doctrines

---

## Summary: Intellectual Assessment

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Logical version: fails (incompatibility unproven)
- Evidential version: weak
  - Cognitive limits
  - Full evidence raises P(God)
  - Christian doctrines increase co-existence probability

---

## Emotional Problem Remains

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Intellectually defused ≠ emotionally resolved
- Responses: presence, compassion, hope
- Head and heart both matter

---

## Discussion

![](EvilPics/jesus.heals.jpg style="float: right; width: 8rem")

- Which version do you encounter most?
- Where do people feel the weight emotionally?
- How can we care well while thinking clearly?
