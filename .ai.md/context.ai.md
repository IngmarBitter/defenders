## Summary

- Fetched and wrote all 51 Craig Doctrine of Christ transcripts (Parts 1-51) as markdown files in `md/Christ/`
- Created 4 summary files: `Craig.Summary1.Incarnation.md`, `Craig.Summary2.Death.md`, `Craig.Summary3.Resurrection.md`, `Craig.Summary4.Access.md`
- Created high-level `Christ.Slides.md` (Markdeep TOC) with 8 sub-slide links
- Slide 1 (Overview) is done
- Slide 2 (Incarnation) is done: all NKJV quotes filled in from BLB, editorial fixes applied, review complete
- Updated `root.ai.md`: removed JW Rebuttal Standards, standardized on ASCII `"` quotes
- Editorial standards now merged into `root.ai.md` (no separate EditorialStandards.md)
- Second review of Slide 2: fixed Gregory of Nyssa->Nazianzus attribution, Luke 22:42-44 quote marks, intermediate margin on Physical Limitations slide, capitalized Christ pronouns
- Added pronoun capitalization rule (He/Him/His for God/Christ/Spirit) to `root.ai.md`
- **Restructured False Models section** of Slide 2:
  - Replaced 6 uneven slides with 14-slide consistent structure
  - Each heresy gets two slides: (1) what it taught + distorted model image + proponent, (2) scriptures refuting it + council history
  - Six heresies covered: Docetism, Apollinarianism, Nestorianism, Eutychianism, Radical Kenosis, Metamorphosis
  - Removed redundant slides: Chalcedon Boundary Markers, Permanent Incarnation, Why Incarnation Matters, Against Radical Kenosis
  - Content from removed slides woven into heresy refutation slides for stronger impact
  - Capstone: Incarnation as Mirror of the Trinity
  - Copied `Trinity.and.JesusTrueGodTrueMan.png` as base for 6 variant images in `docs/Christ/pics/FalseModel.*.png`
  - **User still needs to edit the 6 variant images** to show each heresy's distortion

- `FalseModel.Nestorianism.png` — TWO separate Person circles in the Jesus area
- `FalseModel.Eutychianism.png` — green and orange circles merged into blended circle
- `FalseModel.RadicalKenosis.png` — Son's circle outside God circle, divine attributes crossed out
- `FalseModel.Metamorphosis.png` — three sequential diagrams: divine only -> human only -> divine only
